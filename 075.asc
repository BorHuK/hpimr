//== Self Actualization Final, Responsibility

// 13211
//It was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts, wandering like a
//stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it seemed, but you couldn’t ever
//get to the end if you gave into the temptation of apparent shortcuts.

// 13212
//At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough stones, robes black
//against the grey walls and trimmed in green, eyes darting from one to each
//other. Torches burned in the windowless sconce, casting light to ward off the
//darkness and heat to ward off the chill of the Slytherin dungeons.

// 13213
//“I am __certain,__” Reese Belka snapped, “absolutely __certain,__
//that was no true ritual. Little firstie witches can’t do that kind of magic,
//and even if they could, who’s ever heard of a Dark ritual which
//__sacrifices__ a sealed horror for - __that?__”

// 13214
//“Were you -” said Lucian Bole. “I mean - after that girl snapped her fingers -”

// 13215
//Belka’s glare should have melted him. “No,” she spat, “I was __not.__”

// 13216
//“That is, she wasn’t naked,” drawled Marcus Flint, his broad shoulders leaning
//back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy stone surface. “Covered in
//chocolate frosting, yes, but not naked.”

// 13217
//“This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses,” said the grim voice
//of Jaime Astorga.

// 13218
//“Yes, well, I’m sorry to be blunt,” Randolph Lee said evenly. The seventh-year
//duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of beard had been allowed to
//grow. “But when someone sticks you to the ceiling, it’s a message, Astorga.
//It’s a message which says: I’m an incredibly powerful Dark Wizard who could’ve
//done anything to you I damn well pleased, and I don’t care if your House is
//offended, either.”

// 13219
//Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that sent chills
//down several spines. “It makes you wonder if you picked the wrong side, doesn’t
//it? I’ve heard tales about __messages__ like that, sent at the old Dark
//Lord’s bidding…”

// 13220
//“I’m not ready to kneel to Potter just yet,” said Astorga, staring hard into
//Jugson’s eyes.

// 13221
//“Neither am I,” said Belka.

// 13222
//Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and forth in his
//fingers, pointing it up and then downward. “Are you a Gryffindor or a
//Slytherin?” said Jugson. “Everyone’s got a price. Everyone smart.”

// 13223
//This statement produced a moment of silence.

// 13224
//“Shouldn’t Malfoy be here?” Bole said tentatively.

// 13225
//Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. “Whatever Malfoy’s plotting, he
//wants to put on an air of innocence. He can’t be seen missing at the same time
//as us.”

// 13226
//“But everyone __knows__ that already,” said Bole. “Even in the other
//Houses.”

// 13227
//“Yes, very clumsy,” said Belka. She snorted. “Malfoy or no, he’s just a little
//firstie and we don’t need him here.”

// 13228
//“I will owl my father,” Jugson said softly, “and __he__ will speak to Lord
//Malfoy himself -” Abruptly, Jugson stopped speaking.

// 13229
//“I don’t know about __you__, dearies,” Belka said with fake sweetness,
//“but __I__ don’t plan on running scared from a false ritual, and
//__I’m__ not done with Potter and his pet mudblood.”

// 13230
//Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.

// 13231
//Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring at.

// 13232
//“You will do __nothing,__” hissed their Head of House. Severus Snape’s
//face was enraged, when he spoke small spots of spittle flew from his mouth,
//further dotting his already-dirtied robes. “You fools have done
//__enough!__ You have embarrassed my House - __lost__ to first-years -
//now you speak of embroiling noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your
//__pathetic__ childish squabbles? __I__ shall deal with this matter.
//__You__ will not embarrass this House again, you will not __risk__
//embarrassing this House again! You are __done__ with fighting witches, and
//if I hear otherwise -”

// 13233
//If you thought they’d be sitting next to each other at dinnertime, after that,
//you’d be quite mistaken.

// 13234
//“What does she __want__ from me?” came the plaintive cry of a boy who, for
//all his extensive reading in the scientific literature, was still a bit naive
//about certain things. “Did she __want__ to get beaten up?”

// 13235
//The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who’d sat down next to him at the dinner-table
//exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some unspoken protocol, the
//most experienced of their number spoke.

// 13236
//“Look,” said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in their competition
//by three witches and a Defense Professor, “the thing you’ve got to understand
//is, just because she’s __angry__ doesn’t mean you lost points. Miss
//Granger is angry because she got all frightened and you’re __there to be
//blamed,__ you understand? But at the same time, even though she won’t admit it,
//she’ll be touched that her boyfriend went to such ridiculous and frankly insane
//lengths to protect her.”

// 13237
//“This is not about __points,__” ground out Harry Potter, the words visibly
//escaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner sat ignored on the table in
//front of him. “This is about __justice.__ And __I. Am. Not. Her.
//Boyfriend!__”

// 13238
//This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all present.

// 13239
//“Yeah, well,” said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, “I think after she kisses you to
//bring you out of Dementation and you stick forty-four bullies to the ceiling
//for her, we’ve gone way past ‘she’s not my girlfriend, really’ and into the
//question of what your kids will be like. Wow, that’s a scary thought…” The
//Ravenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, “Please don’t look at
//me like that.”

// 13240
//“Look,” said Arty Grey, “I’m sorry to be blunt about this, but you can have
//justice or you can have girls, you can’t have both at the same time.” He
//clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder. “You’ve got potential,
//kid, more potential than any wizard I’ve ever seen, but you’ve got to learn how
//to __use__ it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to
//clean up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your evilness
//better - not __too__ well, but better. Nice well-groomed boys get girls,
//and Dark Wizards also get girls, but nice well-groomed boys suspected of being
//__secretly__ Dark get more girls than you can imagine -”

// 13241
//“Not interested,” Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy’s hand from his
//shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.

// 13242
//“But you will be,” said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding. “Ah, you will
//be!”

// 13243
//Elsewhere along the same table -

// 13244
//“__Romantic?__” shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that some of the
//girls next to her winced. ”__What part of that was romantic?__ He didn’t
//__ask!__ He never __asks!__ He just sends ghosts after people and
//glues them to ceilings and does whatever he wants with __my__ life!”

// 13245
//“But don’t you see?” said a fourth-year witch. “It means that even though he’s
//evil, he __loves__ you!”

// 13246
//“You’re not helping,” said Penelope Clearwater a little further down the table,
//but she was ignored. Several older witches had started toward Hermione, after
//she’d sat down at the extreme opposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but
//then a swifter cloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an
//impenetrable barrier.

// 13247
//“Boys,” said Hermione Granger, “should not be allowed to love girls without
//asking them first! This is true in a number of ways and especially when it
//comes to gluing people to the ceiling!”

// 13248
//This was also ignored. “It’s just like a play!” sighed a third-year girl.

// 13249
//“A play?” said Hermione. “I’d like to see the play where anything like
//__this__ happens!”

// 13250
//“Oh,” said the third-year girl, “I was thinking of that really
//__romantic__ one where there’s this very nice, sweet boy who makes a Floo
//call, only he mispronounces his destination and stumbles out into this room
//full of Dark Wizards who are performing a forbidden ritual that should’ve
//stayed forever lost to time, and they’re sacrificing seven victims in order to
//unseal this ancient horror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it’s
//freed, so of course the boy’s presence interrupts the ritual, and as the horror
//is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the boy’s last thought is
//that he wishes he could’ve had a girlfriend, and the next thing you know the
//boy is lying in the lap of this beautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a
//dreadful light, only she doesn’t understand anything about being human so the
//boy always has to stop her eating people. This is just like that play, only
//you’re the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!”

// 13251
//“That…” Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. “That actually __does__
//sound something like -”

// 13252
//“It __does?__” blurted a second-year girl sitting across the table, who
//was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet even more fascinated.

// 13253
//“No!” said Hermione. “I mean - __he’s not my boyfriend!__”

// 13254
//Two seconds later, Hermione’s ears caught up with what her lips had just said.

// 13255
//The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione’s shoulder and gave her a
//comforting squeeze. “Miss Granger,” she said in a soothing voice, “I think if
//you’re really honest with yourself, you’ll admit that the real reason you’re
//angry with your dark master is that he channeled his unspeakable powers through
//Tracey Davis instead of you.”

// 13256
//Hermione’s mouth opened but her throat locked up before the words came out,
//which was probably a good thing, because if she’d actually yelled that loudly
//it would’ve broken something.

// 13257
//“How’s that possible, actually?” said the third-year girl. “I mean for Harry
//Potter to work through another girl even though he’s bound himself to you? Do
//the three of you have one of those, you know, arrangements?”

// 13258
//“__Gaaaaack,__” said Hermione Granger, her throat still locked, her brain
//halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making a noise like she was coughing
//up a yak.

// 13259
//__(Later.)__

// 13260
//“I don’t understand why you’re being so __unreasonable__,” said another
//second-year witch, who’d replaced the third-year-girl after Hermione had
//threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. “I mean, really, if someone like
//Harry Potter rescued __me__, I’d be - sending him thank-you cards, and
//hugging him, and,” the girl’s face was a bit red, “well, kissing him, I’d
//hope.”

// 13261
//“Yeah!” said the other second-year witch. “I’ve never understood why girls in
//plays get __angry__ when the main character goes out of his way to be nice
//to them. __I__ wouldn’t act like that if the hero liked __me.__”

// 13262
//Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, her hands slowly
//pulling at her hair.

// 13263
//“You just don’t understand male psychology,” the fourth-year witch said in an
//authoritative voice. “Granger’s got to make it __look__ like she can
//mysteriously resist his seductive charm.”

// 13264
//__(Even later.)__

// 13265
//And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only person left she
//could talk to, the only person guaranteed to understand her point of view -

// 13266
//“They’re all mad,” said Hermione Granger as she strode vigorously toward
//Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early. “Everyone except you and me,
//Harry, I mean __everyone__ except us in this whole school of Hogwarts,
//they’re all entirely __mad.__ And Ravenclaw girls are the __worst,__
//I don’t know __what__ Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older, but
//I’m certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me if the two of
//us had soul-bonded, which I’m going to look up in the library tonight, but I’m
//pretty sure has never actually happened -”

// 13267
//“I don’t even know a __name__ for this kind of fallacious reasoning,” said
//Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which meant he often had to skip
//forward a few steps to match her own indignation-fueled speed. “I seriously
//think if it was up to __them__, they’d be dragging us off this minute to
//get our names changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger… Ugh, saying that out loud
//makes me realize how awful it sounds.”

// 13268
//“You mean __your__ name would be Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger and
//__mine__ would be Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres,” said Hermione. “It’s too
//horrible to imagine.”

// 13269
//“No,” said the boy, “House Potter is a Noble House, so I think that name stays
//in front -”

// 13270
//“__What?__” she said indignantly. “Who says __we__ have to -”

// 13271
//There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of their shoes.

// 13272
//“__Anyhow,__” Hermione said hastily, “some of the crazy things they said
//at dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say, Harry, that I really am
//grateful to you for saving me and everybody from getting beat up, and even
//though some parts of this afternoon upset me, I’m sure we can just talk about
//it calmly.”

// 13273
//“Ah…” Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes showing a mixture
//of befuddlement and apprehension, “that’s… good, I guess?”

// 13274
//To be specific, there’d been the fourth-year witch explaining that, since Harry
//was the evil wizard who’d fallen in love with Hermione, and Hermione was the
//pure and innocent girl who would either redeem him or get seduced by the Dark
//Arts herself, it followed that Hermione __had__ to be perpetually
//indignant at anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from
//certain doom, just so that their romance wouldn’t resolve itself before the end
//of Act IV. And __then__ Penelope Clearwater, who Hermione had really
//thought was smarter than that, had remarked in a loud voice that for identical
//reasons it was __impossible__ for Hermione to just go over and talk
//sensibly with Harry about why she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards
//were attracted to passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This was the point
//at which Hermione had shoved herself up from the benches, stomped furiously
//over to where Harry was sitting, and asked him in a reasonable voice if the two
//of them could go for a walk and sort things out.

// 13275
//“So in other words,” Hermione said in her calmest voice ever, “you’re not
//really in trouble with me, I’m still talking to you, we’re still friends, and
//we’re still studying together. We’re __not__ having a fight. Right?”

// 13276
//Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter’s apprehension. “Right,” said
//the Boy-Who-Lived.

// 13277
//“Great!” said Hermione. “So, __have__ you worked out why I was upset, Mr.
//Potter?”

// 13278
//There was a pause. “You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?” Harry said
//cautiously. “I mean - I know you wanted to do things on your own. And I
//__was__ staying out of your way, until I’d heard you’d gotten ambushed by
//three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I wasn’t expecting that.
//__Professor Quirrell__ wasn’t expecting that. I started to worry you’d
//gotten in over your head and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a
//massed ambush is way beyond what __anyone__ could handle without help.
//That’s why I thought you really needed help just that once -”

// 13279
//“No, that part’s fine,” said Hermione. “We __were__ in over our heads,
//honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter.”

// 13280
//“Um,” said Harry. “What Tracey did… startled you?”

// 13281
//“Startled me, Mr. Potter?” There might have been a touch of acidity in her
//voice. “No, Mr. Potter, I was __scared.__ I was __frightened.__ I
//wouldn’t want to admit to being afraid of just __dragons__ or something,
//people might think I was __cowardly__, but when you can hear distant
//voices crying ‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!’ and there’s pools of blood seeping out
//from under all the doors, then it’s okay to be scared.”

// 13282
//“I __am__ sorry,” Harry said with what sounded like genuine regret. “I
//thought you’d realize it was me.”

// 13283
//“And the __reason__ we all got scared like that, Mr. Potter, was that
//__you didn’t ask first!__” Despite her intentions, Hermione found her
//voice was rising again. “You should’ve __asked__ me before you did
//something like that, Harry! You should’ve said very specifically, ‘Hermione,
//can I make blood come out from under the doors?’ It’s important to be specific
//when you’re asking about that sort of thing!”

// 13284
//The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. “I… honestly, I just thought
//you’d __have__ to say no.”

// 13285
//“Yes, Mr. Potter, __I could’ve said no__. That’s __the whole point
//of asking first__, Mr. Potter!”

// 13286
//“No, I mean you’d have __had__ to say no, whether or not it was what you
//__really__ wanted. And then all of you would’ve gotten beaten up and it
//would’ve been __my__ fault for asking first.”

// 13287
//Hermione’s eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept walking for a
//few steps while she tried to understand this. “What?” she said.

// 13288
//“Well…” the boy said a bit slowly. “I mean… you’re the Sunshine General, aren’t
//you? You __couldn’t__ say yes to me scaring people, not even bullies, not
//even to save your friends from getting beaten up. You would’ve __had__ to
//say no, and then you would’ve gotten hurt. This way, you can tell people
//honestly that you had no idea and that it wasn’t your fault. That’s why I
//didn’t warn you.”

// 13289
//Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead of just turning
//her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said, “Harry, you’ve __got__
//to stop coming up with clever reasons for doing stupid things.”

// 13290
//Harry’s eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, “Look… I know what you mean,
//of course, but there’s still the question of whether it’s actually __is__
//a good idea, not just a clever one -”

// 13291
//“I understand why you did what you did today,” Hermione said. “But I want you
//to promise that from now on, you’ll ask me first, always, even if you can come
//up with a reason why you shouldn’t.”

// 13292
//There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her heart sinking.

// 13293
//“Hermione -” Harry started to say.

// 13294
//“__Why?__” The frustration burst out into her voice. ”__Why is it so
//awful? All you have to do is ask!”__

// 13295
//Harry’s eyes were very serious. “Who in S.P.H.E.W. do you try hardest to
//defend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you fight?”

// 13296
//“Hannah Abbott,” Hermione said without having to think about it, and then felt
//a little bad, because Hannah __was__ trying hard and she __had__
//improved a lot -

// 13297
//“Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey, with
//__final__ responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you knew Hannah was
//about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with a plan for protecting her,
//would you feel good about letting Tracey say whether or not you were allowed to
//do it?”

// 13298
//“Well… no?” said Hermione, puzzled.

// 13299
//The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. “Would you trust
//__Hannah__ to have the final say in whether she needed protecting?”

// 13300
//“I -” said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew the right answer
//and she also knew the right answer wasn’t actually true. Hannah was trying so
//hard to prove she wasn’t afraid, even though she __was,__ and it was easy
//to see how the Hufflepuff girl might try __too__ hard -

// 13301
//Then Hermione realized the implication. “You think I’m like __Hannah?__”

// 13302
//“Not… exactly…” Harry ran his hands through his mess of hair. “Listen,
//Hermione, what would __you__ have suggested doing, if I’d warned you about
//an ambush by forty-four bullies?”

// 13303
//“I would’ve done the __responsible__ thing and told __Professor
//McGonagall__ and let __her__ take care of it,” Hermione said promptly. “And
//__then__ there wouldn’t have been darkness and people screaming and
//horrible blue light -”

// 13304
//But Harry just shook his head. “That’s __not__ the responsible thing to
//do, Hermione. It’s what someone playing the __role__ of a responsible girl
//would do. __Yes__, I thought of going to Professor McGonagall. But she
//would’ve only stopped the disaster __once.__ Probably before any
//disturbance happened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew.
//If the bullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by losing House
//points, or at worst a day’s detention, not anything that would really scare
//them. And then the bullies would have __tried again__. Fewer of them, with
//better operational security so I didn’t hear about it. They would probably
//ambush __one__ of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn’t have the
//__authority__ to do something scary enough to protect you - and
//__she__ wouldn’t have overstepped her authority, because she’s not really
//responsible.”

// 13305
//“__Professor McGonagall__ isn’t responsible?” Hermione said incredulously.
//She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring at him. “Are you
//__nuts?”__

// 13306
//The boy didn’t blink. “You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe,” Harry
//Potter said. “Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever happens, no
//matter what, it’s __always__ your fault. Even if you tell Professor
//McGonagall, she’s not responsible for what happens, __you__ are. Following
//the school rules isn’t an excuse, someone else being in charge isn’t an excuse,
//even trying your best isn’t an excuse. There just aren’t any excuses, you’ve
//got to __get the job done no matter what__.” Harry’s face tightened.
//“That’s why I say you’re not thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking that your
//job is done when you tell Professor McGonagall - that isn’t heroine thinking.
//Like Hannah being beat up is __okay __then, because it isn’t __your
//fault __anymore. Being a heroine means your job isn’t finished until you’ve
//done__ whatever it takes__ to protect the other girls,
//__permanently.__” In Harry’s voice was a touch of the steel he had
//acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. “You can’t think as if
//just following the rules means you’ve done your duty.”

// 13307
//“I think,” Hermione said evenly, “that you and I might disagree about some
//things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor McGonagall is more
//__responsible__, and whether being __responsible__ usually involves
//people running around and screaming, and how much it’s a good idea to follow
//school rules. And just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn’t mean that
//__you__ get the final say.”

// 13308
//“Well,” said Harry, “you asked what was __so__ awful about having to ask
//you first, and it was a surprisingly good question, so I examined my mind and
//that’s what I found. I think my real fear is that if Hannah is in trouble and I
//come up with a way to save her that seems weird or dark or something, you might
//not weigh the consequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine’s
//responsibility of coming up with __some__ way to save her, somehow, no
//matter what. Instead you’d just carry out the __role__ of Hermione
//Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and the __role__ of Hermione Granger
//automatically says no, whether or not she has a better plan in mind. And then
//forty-four bullies will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it’ll all be
//my fault because I __knew,__ even if I didn’t want reality to be that way,
//I knew that was how it would go. I’m pretty sure that was my secret, wordless,
//unutterable fear.”

// 13309
//The frustration was building up inside her again. “It’s __my__ life!”
//Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing
//with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first
//and not to listen to her objections. She shouldn’t have to __win an
//argument__ just to - “There’ll __always__ be some reason, you can
//__always__ say I’m not thinking right! I want my__ own life!__
//Otherwise I’ll walk away, I really will, I mean it Harry.”

// 13310
//Harry sighed. “This is exactly where I didn’t want things to end up, and here
//we are. You’re afraid of just the same thing I am, aren’t you? Afraid that if
//__you__ let go of the steering wheel, we’ll crash.” The corners of his
//lips twisted, but it didn’t look like a real smile. “That’s something I can
//understand.”

// 13311
//“I don’t think you understand __at all!__” Hermione said sharply. “You
//said we’d be __partners,__ Harry!”

// 13312
//That stopped him, she could see it stop him.

// 13313
//“How about this?” Harry said at last. “I’ll promise to ask you first before I
//do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in your affairs. Only
//__you’ve__ got to promise __me__ to be reasonable, Hermione. I mean
//__really__, genuinely, stop and think for twenty seconds first, treat it
//as a real choice. The sort of reasonableness where you realize I’m offering a
//way to protect the other girls, and that if you automatically say __no__
//without considering it properly, there’s this __actual consequence__ where
//Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital.”

// 13314
//Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.

// 13315
//“Well?” said Harry.

// 13316
//“I shouldn’t have to make promises,” she said, “just to be __consulted__
//about __my own life.__” She turned from Harry and began walking toward the
//Ravenclaw tower, not looking at him. “But I’ll think about it, anyway.”

// 13317
//She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for a while,
//passing through an archway of some reddish metal like copper, into a corridor
//that was just like the one they’d left except that it was tiled in pentagons
//instead of squares.

// 13318
//“Hermione…” said Harry. “I’ve been watching you and thinking, since the day you
//said you were going to be a hero. You’ve __got__ the courage. You’ll fight
//for what’s right, even in the face of enemies that would scare other people
//away. You’ve certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you’re probably a
//better person inside than I am. But even so… well, to be honest, Hermione… I
//can’t quite see you filling Dumbledore’s shoes, leading magical Britain’s fight
//against You-Know-Who. Not yet, anyway.”

// 13319
//Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on walking, as
//though lost in thought. Fill __those__ shoes? She’d never tried to imagine
//herself that way. She’d never __imagined__ imagining herself that way.

// 13320
//“And maybe I’m wrong,” Harry said as they walked. “Maybe I’ve just read too
//many stories where the heroes never do the sensible thing and follow the rules
//and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so my brain doesn’t think you’re a proper
//storybook hero. Maybe it’s you who’s the sane one, Hermione, and me who’s just
//being silly. But every time you talk about following rules or relying on
//teachers, I get that same feeling, like it’s bound up with this one last thing
//that’s stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC self to sleep and turns
//you into an NPC again…” Harry let out a sigh. “Maybe that’s why Dumbledore said
//I should have wicked stepparents.”

// 13321
//“He said __what?__”

// 13322
//Harry nodded. “I still don’t know whether the Headmaster was joking or… the
//thing is, he was __right__ in a way. I __had__ loving parents, but I
//never felt like I could trust their decisions, they weren’t __sane__
//enough. I always knew that if I didn’t think things through myself, I might get
//hurt. Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done
//__if__ I’m there to nag her about it, she doesn’t break rules on her own
//without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really __is__ someone who
//gets things done no matter what, and he’s the only other person I know who
//notices stuff like the Snitch ruining Quidditch. But__ him__ I can’t trust
//to be __good__. Even if it’s sad, I think that’s part of the environment
//that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don’t have anyone else
//to shove final responsibility onto, and that’s why they form the mental habit
//of tracking everything themselves.”____

// 13323
//____

// 13324
//Hermione didn’t say anything to that, but she was thinking back to something
//Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very short autobiography.
//Briefly and without any explanation, because the scroll had been meant to be
//copied by hand, centuries before the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards
//to invent the Reading-Writing Quill.

// 13325
//__No rescuer hath the rescuer,__ Godric Gryffindor had written. __No
//Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father, only nothingness above.__

// 13326
//If __that__ was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn’t sure she wanted
//to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn’t the sort of thing she would have
//thought, before she started hanging around Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had
//gotten it __wrong__.

// 13327
//“Do you trust __Dumbledore?”__ Hermione said. “I mean, he’s right here in
//our school and he’s the most legendary hero in the whole world -”

// 13328
//“He __was__ the most legendary hero,” said Harry. “Now he sets chickens on
//fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to __you?__”

// 13329
//Hermione didn’t answer.

// 13330
//Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral stairs, the steps
//alternating between bronze metal and blue stone; the final approach to where
//the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard their dorm with silly riddles.

// 13331
//“Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you,” Harry said when they
//were about halfway up. “Since it affects your life and all. Think of it as a
//sort of down payment -”

// 13332
//“What is it?” said Hermione.

// 13333
//“I predict S.P.H.E.W. is about to retire.”

// 13334
//“__Retire?__” Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of the stairs.

// 13335
//“Yeah,” Harry said. “I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the teachers are
//about to clamp down hard on fighting in the corridors.” Harry was grinning as
//he spoke, a glint in his eyes behind the glasses hinting at secret knowledge.
//“Cast new wards to detect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of
//bullying using Veritaserum - I can think of several ways they might shut it
//down. But if I’m right, it’s something to celebrate, Hermione, you and all of
//you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that you got them to actually
//__do__ something about the bullying. __All__ the bullying.”

// 13336
//Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she reached the top of
//the stairs and began walking toward the Ravenclaw portrait for her riddle,
//Hermione felt rather lighter on her feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading
//through her like she’d been pumped full of helium.

// 13337
//Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in, she hadn’t
//expected __that__ much, she hadn’t expected it to actually __work__.

// 13338
//They’d made a __difference…__

// 13339
//It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.

// 13340
//The students from every year sat very still in their benches, all heads turned
//in the same direction, toward the Head Table, before which one lone first-year
//girl stood rigid and motionless, her head tilted back to stare up at the Head
//of House Slytherin.

// 13341
//Professor Snape’s face was twisted with fury and triumph, vindictive as any
//painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the other Professors sat at the Head
//Table, watching with faces as though carved from stone.

// 13342
//“- permanently disbanded,” spat the Potions Master. “Your self-proclaimed
//Society is __outlawed__ within Hogwarts, by my decision as a Professor! If
//your Society or any member of it is discovered fighting in the hallways again,
//Granger, you will be __personally__ held responsible and expelled, by me,
//from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”

// 13343
//That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where she’d been called
//before only to receive commendations and smiles; stood there with her spine
//held tall and upright in its curve like a centaur’s bow, giving nothing to the
//enemy.

// 13344
//That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger bottled, her face
//still, nothing changing of her outward appearance, while something slowly broke
//inside her, she could feel it breaking.

// 13345
//It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks detention for the
//crime of violence in school, sneering with the contemptuous face he’d shown
//them all on the first day of Potions, and with a little twist in the corner of
//his smile that said the Potions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.

// 13346
//Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top to bottom,
//when Professor Snape took one hundred points from Ravenclaw.

// 13347
//It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.

// 13348
//She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry Potter was sitting
//still in his place, she couldn’t see his expression from here, she saw his
//fists on the table but she couldn’t see if they were clenched white like her
//own. She had whispered to him, when Professor Snape had called her, that he
//wasn’t to do anything without asking first.

// 13349
//Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as Snape was
//turning away from her to resume his place.

// 13350
//“I said you’re dismissed, girl,” said the sneering voice, but there was a
//pleased smile on Snape’s face, like he was waiting for her to do something -

// 13351
//Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Table and said in a
//breaking voice, “Headmaster?”

// 13352
//Utter silence filled the Great Hall.

// 13353
//Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn’t move. It was as though he, too, was
//just carved from stone.

// 13354
//Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose head, barely
//visible above the table, seemed to be staring down into his lap. Beside him,
//Professor Sprout’s face was very tight, she seemed to be forcing herself to
//watch, and her lips were trembling, but she said nothing.

// 13355
//Professor McGonagall’s chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistress hadn’t shown up
//to breakfast that morning.

// 13356
//“Why aren’t any of you saying anything?” said Hermione Granger. Her voice was
//trembling with the last of her hope, the last desperate reach for help from
//that place inside her. “You __know__ what he’s doing is wrong!”

// 13357
//“Two more weeks’ detention, for insolence,” Snape said silkily.

// 13358
//It shattered.

// 13359
//She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at Professor Flitwick
//and Professor Sprout and the empty place where Professor McGonagall should’ve
//been. Then Hermione Granger turned and began walking toward the Ravenclaw
//table.

// 13360
//There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came unfrozen from
//where they’d sat.

// 13361
//And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table -

// 13362
//The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and that voice
//said, “One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what is right.”

// 13363
//Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued forward, even as
//Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor Quirrell leaned back in his
//chair and began to laugh, even as Dumbledore’s voice was saying something she
//didn’t catch and then she was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table again next to
//Harry Potter.

// 13364
//Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone who didn’t dare
//move.

// 13365
//“It’s all right,” her voice said to him, automatically without there being any
//choice or thought involved, although really it wasn’t right at all. “But can
//you see if you can get me out of Snape’s detentions, like you did yourself that
//time?”

// 13366
//Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. “I -” said Harry. “I -
//I’m sorry, this - this is all my fault -”

// 13367
//“Don’t be __ridiculous__, Harry.” It was odd how her voice was coming out
//all normal, and without her thinking about what to say. Hermione looked down at
//her breakfast plate, but eating seemed to be clearly out of the question, there
//was a roiling and churning in her stomach which suggested that she was already
//on the verge of throwing up, which was odd because she could have sworn her
//whole body felt numb, like she wasn’t feeling anything, at the same time.

// 13368
//“And,” her voice said, “if you want to break school rules or something, you can
//ask me about it, I promise I won’t just say no.”

// 13369
//Non est salvatori salvator,

// 13370
//neque defensori dominus,

// 13371
//nec pater nec mater,

// 13372
//nihil supernum.

// 13373
//- Godric Gryffindor,

// 13374
//1202 C.E.
