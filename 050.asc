//== Self Centeredness

// 9037
//Padma Patil had finished her dinner a little late, getting on toward
//seven-thirty, and was now striding quickly out of the Great Hall on her way to
//the Ravenclaw dorm and the study rooms. Gossiping was fun and destroying
//Granger’s reputation was more fun, but it could distract from schoolwork. She’d
//put off a six-inch essay on __lomillialor__ wood due in next morning’s
//Herbology class, and she needed to finish it tonight.

// 9038
//It was while she was passing through a long, twisting, narrow stone corridor
//that the whisper came, sounding like it was coming from right behind her.

// 9039
//“__Padma Patil…__”

// 9040
//She spun around quick as lightning, her wand already snatched up from a pocket
//of her robes and leaping into her hands, if Harry Potter thought he could sneak
//up on and scare __her__ that easily -

// 9041
//There was no one there.

// 9042
//Instantly Padma spun around and looked in the other direction, if it had been a
//Ventriloquism Charm -

// 9043
//There was no one there, either.

// 9044
//The whispering sigh came again, soft and dangerous with a slight hissing
//undertone.

// 9045
//“__Padma Patil, Slytherin girl…__”

// 9046
//“Harry Potter, Slytherin boy,” she said out loud.

// 9047
//She’d fought Potter and his Chaos Legion a dozen times over, and she
//__knew__ that this was Harry Potter doing this somehow…

// 9048
//…even though the Ventriloquism Charm was only line-of-sight, and in the winding
//corridor, she could easily see all the way to the nearest twist both forward
//and backward, and there was no one there…

// 9049
//…it didn’t matter. She knew her enemy.

// 9050
//There was a whispery chuckle, now coming from beside her, and she spun around
//and pointed her wand at the whisper and shouted “__Luminos!__”

// 9051
//The red bolt of light shot out and struck the wall, which lit with a crimson
//glow that soon faded.

// 9052
//She hadn’t really expected it to work. Harry Potter couldn’t __possibly__
//be invisible, not really invisible, that was magic most __grownups__
//couldn’t do, and she’d never believed nine-tenths of the stories about him.

// 9053
//The whispery voice laughed again, now on her other side.

// 9054
//“Harry Potter stands on the precipice,” whispered the voice, now sounding very
//close to her ear, “he is wavering, but you, you are already falling, Slytherin
//girl…”

// 9055
//“The hat never called out Slytherin for __my__ name, Potter!” She backed
//up against the wall, so she wouldn’t have to watch behind herself, and raised
//her wand in an attack stance.

// 9056
//Again the soft laugh. “Harry Potter has been in the Ravenclaw common room for
//the last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle and Michael Corner rehearse
//Potions recipes. But it matters not. I am here to deliver a warning to you,
//Padma Patil, and if you choose to ignore it, that is your own affair.”

// 9057
//“Fine,” she said coldly. “Go ahead and warn me, Potter, I’m not afraid of you.”

// 9058
//“Slytherin was a great House, once,” said the whisper; it sounded sadder, now.
//“Slytherin was once a House you would have been proud to choose, Padma Patil.
//But something turned wrong, something turned sour; do you know what went awry
//in Slytherin House, Padma Patil?”

// 9059
//“No, and I don’t care!”

// 9060
//“But you should care,” said the whisper, now sounding like it was coming from
//just behind her head where it stood almost pressed against the wall. “For you
//are still that girl whom the Sorting Hat offered that choice. Do you think that
//just choosing Ravenclaw means that you are not Pansy Parkinson, and will not
//ever become Pansy Parkinson, no matter how you conduct yourself otherwise?”

// 9061
//Despite everything, now, small chills of fear were spreading out from her spine
//and running over her skin. She’d heard __those__ stories about Harry
//Potter too, that he was a secret Legilimens. But she still stood straight, and
//she put all the bite she could into her voice when she said, “The Slytherins
//went Dark to get power, just like __you__ did, Potter. And __I__
//won’t, not ever.”

// 9062
//“But you’ll spread vicious rumors about an innocent girl,” whispered the voice,
//“even though it will not help you attain any of your own ambitions, and without
//considering that she has powerful allies who might take offense. That is not
//the proud Slytherin of the old days, Padma Patil, that is not the pride of
//Salazar, that is Slytherin gone rotten, Padma Parkinson not Padma Malfoy…”

// 9063
//She was getting more creeped out than she ever had been in her life, and the
//possibility was starting to occur to her that this might __really__ be a
//ghost. She hadn’t ever heard that ghosts could hide themselves like this, but
//maybe they just didn’t usually do it - not to mention that most ghosts weren’t
//this __eerie,__ they were just dead people after all - “Who __are__
//you? The Bloody Baron?”

// 9064
//“When Harry Potter was bullied and beaten,” the voice whispered, “he commanded
//all his allies to refrain from vengeance; do you remember that, Padma Patil?
//For Harry Potter is wavering, but not yet lost; he is struggling, he knows
//himself to be in peril. But Hermione Granger made no such request of her own
//allies. Harry Potter is angered with you now, Padma Patil, more angered than he
//would ever be on his own behalf… and __he__ has allies of his own.”

// 9065
//A shudder went through her, she knew that it was visible and she hated herself
//for it.

// 9066
//“Oh, don’t be afraid,” breathed the voice. “I will not hurt you. For you see,
//Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly is innocent. __She__ does not stand on
//the precipice, __she__ is not falling. She did not ask her allies to
//refrain from hurting you, because the thought did not even occur to her as a
//possibility. And Harry Potter knows very well that if he hurt you or caused you
//to be hurt, for Hermione Granger’s sake, then she would never speak to him
//again until the Sun burned low and the last star failed in the night sky.” The
//voice was very sad now. “She truly is a kindly girl, a person such as I could
//only wish to be…”

// 9067
//“Granger can’t cast the Patronus Charm!” said Padma. “If she was really as nice
//as she pretends to be -”

// 9068
//“Can __you__ cast the Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You dared not even
//attempt it, you feared what the result would be.”

// 9069
//“That’s not __true!__ I didn’t have time, that was all!”

// 9070
//The whisper continued. “But Hermione Granger did try, openly before her
//friends, and when her magic failed she was surprised and dismayed. For there
//are secrets to the Patronus Charm that few ever knew, and maybe none now know
//but I.” A soft, whispery chuckle. “Let it stand that it is no stain of her
//spirit that halts her light from coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast the
//Patronus Charm for the very same reason that Godric Gryffindor, who raised
//these halls, never could.”

// 9071
//The corridor __was__ becoming colder, she was certain of it, as though
//someone were using the Chilling Charm.

// 9072
//“And Harry Potter is not Hermione Granger’s only ally.” Now there was an
//undertone of dry amusement in that whisper, it reminded her suddenly and
//frighteningly of Professor Quirrell. “Filius Flitwick and Minerva McGonagall
//are quite fond of her, I do believe. Did it occur to you that if those two
//learned what you were doing to Hermione Granger, they might become less fond of
//you? They might not intervene openly, perhaps; but they might be a little
//slower to award you House Points, a little slower to steer opportunities your
//way -”

// 9073
//“Potter __snarked__ on me?”

// 9074
//A ghostly chuckle, a dry heh-heh-heh. “Do you think those two are stupid, deaf
//and blind?” In a sadder whisper, “Do you think Hermione Granger is not precious
//to them, that they will not see her hurting? As they might have been fond of
//you once, their bright young Padma Patil, but you are throwing it away…”

// 9075
//Padma’s throat was dry. She hadn’t thought of that, not at all.

// 9076
//“I wonder how many people will end up caring for you, Padma Patil, on this path
//that you now tread. Is it worth that much, just to distance yourself further
//from your sister? To be the shadow to Parvati’s light? Your deepest fear has
//always been to fall into harmony with her, __back__ into harmony with her
//I should say; but is it worth hurting an innocent girl, just to make yourself
//that much more different? Must you be the __evil__ twin, Padma Patil, can
//you not find a different good to pursue?”

// 9077
//Her heart was hammering in her chest. She’d, she’d never talked about that with
//__anyone -__

// 9078
//“I have always wondered at how students bully each other,” sighed the voice.
//“How children make life difficult for themselves, how they turn their schools
//into prisons even with their own hands. Why do human beings make their own
//lives so unpleasant? I can give you a part of the answer, Padma Patil. It is
//because people do not stop and think before causing pain, if they do not
//imagine that they themselves could also be hurt, that they might also suffer
//from their own misdeeds. But suffer you will, oh, yes, Padma Patil, suffer you
//will, if you stay on this road. You will suffer the same pain of loneliness,
//the same pain of others’ fear and distrust, that you now inflict on Hermione
//Granger. Only for you it will be deserved.”

// 9079
//Her wand was shaking in her hand.

// 9080
//“You did not choose sides when you went to Ravenclaw, girl. You choose your
//side by the way you live your life, what you do to other people and what you do
//to yourself. Will you illuminate others’ lives, or darken them? That is the
//choice between Light and Dark, not any word the Sorting Hat cries out. And the
//hard part, Padma Patil, is not saying ‘Light’, the hard part is deciding which
//is which, and admitting it to yourself when you begin down the wrong road.”

// 9081
//There was silence. It went on for a time, and Padma realized that she had been
//dismissed.

// 9082
//Padma almost dropped her wand, when she tried to put it back into her pocket.
//She almost fell, when she took a step forward away from the wall, and turned to
//go -

// 9083
//“I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark,” the whisper said,
//now loud and harsh directly into her ear. “Do not take my wisdom as a final
//word, girl, do not fear to question it, for though I tried I have sometimes
//failed, oh, yes, I have failed. But you are hurting a true innocent, and you
//will achieve none of your ambitions by doing so, it is not for any cunning
//plan. You are inflicting pain purely for the sake of the pleasure it brings
//you. I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark, but that I know
//for darkness, for certain. You are hurting an innocent girl, and escaping
//retribution only because she is too kindly to tolerate her allies moving
//against you. I cannot hurt you for that, so know only that I cannot respect it.
//You are unworthy of Slytherin; go and do your Herbology homework, Ravenclaw
//girl!”

// 9084
//The final whisper came out in a louder hiss that sounded almost like a snake,
//and Padma fled, she fled down the corridors like Lethifolds were chasing her,
//she ran heedless of the rules about running in the corridors, even when she
//passed other students who looked at her in surprise, she did not stop, she ran
//all the way to the Ravenclaw dorms with her pulse pounding in her neck, the
//door asked her “Why does the Sun shine in the day instead of the nighttime?”
//and it took her three tries before she could make her answer coherent, and then
//the door came open and she saw -

// 9085
//- a few girls and boys, some young and some old, all staring at her, and in one
  //corner at the pentagonal table, Harry Potter and Michael Corner and Kevin
//Entwhistle, looking up from their textbooks.

// 9086
//“Sweet Merlin!” exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising from a couch. “What
//happened to you, Padma?”

// 9087
//“I,” she stuttered, “I, I heard - a ghost -”

// 9088
//“It wasn’t the Bloody Baron, was it?” said Clearwater. She drew her wand and a
//moment later she was holding a cup, and then an __Aguamenti__ later the
//cup was filled with water. “Here, drink this, sit down -”

// 9089
//Padma was already striding toward the pentagonal table. She looked at Harry
//Potter, who was looking at her with his own gaze, calm and grave and a little
//sad.

// 9090
//“__You__ did this!” Padma said. “How - you - how dare you!”

// 9091
//There was a sudden hush in the Ravenclaw dorm.

// 9092
//Harry just looked at her.

// 9093
//And said, “Is there anything I can help you with?”

// 9094
//“Don’t deny it,” Padma said, her voice shaking, “__you__ set that ghost on
//me, it __said__ -”

// 9095
//“I mean it,” Harry said. “Can I help you with anything? Get you some food, or
//go fetch a soda for you, or help you with your homework, or anything like
//that?”

// 9096
//Everyone was staring at the two of them.

// 9097
//“Why?” Padma said. She couldn’t think of anything else to say, she didn’t
//understand.

// 9098
//“Because some of us are standing on the precipice,” Harry said. “And the
//difference is what you do for other people. Will you let me help you with
//something, Padma, please?”

// 9099
//She stared at him, and knew, in that moment, that he’d gotten his own warning,
//same as her.

// 9100
//“I…” she said. “I’ve got to write six inches on __lomillialor__ -”

// 9101
//“Let me run up to my dorm room and get my Herbology stuff,” Harry said. He rose
//from the pentagonal table, looked at Entwhistle and Corner. “Sorry, guys, I’ll
//see you later.”

// 9102
//They didn’t say anything, just stared, along with everyone else in the dorm
//room, as Harry Potter walked over to the stairs.

// 9103
//And just as he started up, he said, “And no one’s to pester her with questions
//unless __she__ wants to talk about it, I hope everyone’s __got
//that?__”

// 9104
//“Got it,” said most of the first years and some of the older students, a few of
//them sounding quite scared.

// 9105
//And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides
//__lomillialor__ wood - even her fear of falling back into harmony with
//Parvati, which she’d never talked about with __anyone__ before, but then
//Harry’s ghostly ally already knew. And Harry had reached into his pouch and
//pulled out some __odd__ books, loaning them to her on condition of
//complete secrecy, saying that if she could comprehend those books it would
//change the pattern of her thinking enough that she’d never fall into harmony
//with Parvati again…

// 9106
//At nine o’ clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was only half done.

// 9107
//And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and said that
//__he __thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made her feel good for a
//whole minute before she realized what had just been said to her and who had
//said it.

// 9108
//When Padma got down to breakfast, that morning, she saw Mandy see her and
//whisper something to the girl sitting beside her at the Ravenclaw table.

// 9109
//She saw that girl get up from the bench and walk toward her.

// 9110
//Last night Padma had been glad that girl roomed in the other dorm; but now that
//she thought about it, this was worse, now she had to do it in front of
//__everyone__.

// 9111
//But even though Padma was sweating, she knew what she had to do.

// 9112
//The girl came closer -

// 9113
//“I’m sorry.”

// 9114
//“What?” said Padma. That was __her__ line.

// 9115
//“I’m sorry,” repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice was loud so that everyone
//could hear. “I… I didn’t ask Harry to do that, and I was angry with him when I
//found out, and I made him promise not to do it again to __anyone__, and
//I’m not talking to him for a week… I’m really, __really __sorry, Miss
//Patil.”

// 9116
//Hermione Granger’s back was stiff, her face was stiff, you could see the sweat
//on her face.

// 9117
//“Um,” said Padma. Her own thoughts were pretty much scrambled, now…

// 9118
//Padma’s gaze flicked to the Ravenclaw table, where one boy was watching them
//with tight eyes and his hands clenched in his lap.

// 9119
//__Earlier:__

// 9120
//“I told you to be __nicer!__” shrieked Hermione.

// 9121
//Harry was starting to sweat. He’d never actually heard Hermione scream at him
//before, and it was quite loud in the empty classroom.

// 9122
//“I - but - but I __was__ nice!” Harry protested. “I practically
//__redeemed__ her, Padma was going down the wrong path and I turned her off
//it! I probably changed her whole life to be happier! Besides, you should’ve
//heard the __original__ version of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do
//-” at which point Harry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a
//second too late.

// 9123
//Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn’t seen from her
//before. “What’d __he__ say to do? __Kill__ her?”

// 9124
//The Defense Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the key influential
//students inside and outside his year and try to gain control of the entire
//Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking that this was a generally useful and amusing
//challenge for any true Slytherin attending Hogwarts.

// 9125
//“Nothing like __that,__” Harry said quickly, “he just said in a general
//way that I should get influence over the people spreading rumors, and
//__I__ decided that the __nice__ version of that would be to just
//inform Padma directly about the meaning of what she was doing, and the possible
//consequences of her actions, instead of trying to threaten her or anything like
//that -”

// 9126
//“__You call that not threatening someone?__” Hermione’s hands were pulling
//at her hair now.

// 9127
//“Um…” Harry said. “I guess she might’ve felt a __little__ threatened, but
//Hermione, people will do whatever they think they can get away with, they don’t
//care about how much it hurts other people if it doesn’t hurt themselves, if
//Padma thinks there’s __no__ consequences to spreading lies about you then
//of __course__ she’ll just go on doing it -”

// 9128
//“And you think there’s going to be no consequences to what __you__ did?”

// 9129
//Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach.

// 9130
//Hermione had the angriest look on her that he’d ever seen. “What do you think
//the other students think of you now, Harry? Of __me?__ If Harry doesn’t
//like the way you talk about Hermione, you’ll get ghosts set on you, is that
//what you want them to think?”

// 9131
//Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just… hadn’t thought about it
//that way, actually…

// 9132
//Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where she’d slammed
//them. “I’m not talking to you for a week, and I’ll __tell__ everyone I’m
//not talking to you for a week, and I’ll tell them __why__, and
//__maybe__ that’ll undo some of what you just did. And after that week,
//I’ll - I’ll decide then what to do, I guess -”

// 9133
//“__Hermione!__” Harry’s own voice rose to a shriek of desperation.
//”__I was trying to help!__”

// 9134
//The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the classroom door.

// 9135
//“Harry,” she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the anger,
//“Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he really is, I mean it,
//Harry.”

// 9136
//“This… wasn’t him, this wasn’t what he said to do, this was just __me__ -”

// 9137
//Hermione’s voice was almost a whisper now. “Someday you’re going to go out to
//lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that comes back, or maybe even
//you won’t come back at all.”

// 9138
//“I promise you,” Harry said, “that I __will__ come back from lunch.”

// 9139
//He wasn’t even thinking as he said it.

// 9140
//And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed the door behind her.

// 9141
//__Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron,__ observed Harry’s
//Internal Critic. __Now you’re going to die this Saturday, your last words
//will be ‘I’m sorry, Hermione’, and she’ll always regret that the last thing she
//did was slam the door -__

// 9142
//__Oh, shut up.__

// 9143
//When Padma sat down with Hermione for breakfast, and said in a voice loud
//enough for others to hear that the ghost had just told her things that were
//important for her to hear, and Harry Potter had been right to do it, there were
//some people who were less frightened afterward, and some who were frightened
//more.

// 9144
//And afterward people __did __say fewer nasty things about Hermione, at
//least in the first year, at least in public where Harry Potter might hear about
//it.

// 9145
//When Professor Flitwick asked Harry if he was responsible for what had happened
//to Padma, and Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick told him that he was to serve
//two days’ detention. Even if it had only been a ghost and Padma hadn’t been
//hurt, still, that wasn’t acceptable behavior for a Ravenclaw student. Harry
//nodded and said that he understood why the Professor had to do that, and
//wouldn’t protest; but considering that it __did __seem to have turned
//Padma around, did Professor Flitwick really think, off the record, that he’d
//done the wrong thing? And Professor Flitwick paused, seeming to actually think
//about it, and then said to Harry, in a solemnly squeaky voice, that he needed
//to learn how to relate to other students the normal way.

// 9146
//And Harry couldn’t help but think that this was advice that Professor Quirrell
//would never give him.

// 9147
//Harry couldn’t help but think that if he’d done it Professor Quirrell’s way,
//the normal __Slytherin __way, a mixture of positive and negative
//incentives to bring Padma and the other rumor-mongers under his explicit
//control, then Padma wouldn’t have talked about it, and Hermione would have
//never found out…

// 9148
//…in which case Padma wouldn’t have been redeemed, she would have stayed on the
//wrong path, and she herself would have suffered from that eventually. It wasn’t
//as if Harry had __lied __to Padma in any way, when he was Time-Turned and
//invisible and using the Ventriloquism Charm.

// 9149
//Harry still wasn’t sure whether he’d done the right thing, or __a__ right
//thing, and Hermione hadn’t relented on not talking to him - though she was
//talking a lot with Padma. It hurt more than Harry had expected, going back to
//studying by himself; like his brain had already started to forget its
//long-honed skill of being alone.

// 9150
//The days until Saturday’s lunch with Professor Quirrell seemed to go by very,
//very slowly.
