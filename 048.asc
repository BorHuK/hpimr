//== Utilitarian Priorities

// 8829
//It was Saturday, the first morning of February, and at the Ravenclaw table, a
//boy bearing a breakfast plate heaped high with vegetables was nervously
//inspecting his servings for the slightest trace of meat.

// 8830
//It __might__ have been an overreaction. After he’d gotten over the raw
//shock, Harry’s common sense had woken up and hypothesized that “Parseltongue”
//was probably just a linguistic user interface for controlling snakes…

// 8831
//…after all, snakes couldn’t __really__ be human-level intelligent,
//__someone__ would have noticed by now. The smallest-brained creatures
//Harry had ever heard of with anything like linguistic ability were the African
//grey parrots taught by Irene Pepperberg. And that was unstructured
//protolanguage, in a species that played complex games of adultery and needed to
//model other parrots. While according to what Draco had been able to remember,
//snakes spoke to Parselmouths in what sounded like normal human language - i.e.,
//full-blown recursive syntactical grammar. That had taken __time__ for
//hominids to evolve, with huge brains and strong social selection pressures.
//Snakes didn’t have much society at all that Harry had ever heard. And with
//thousands upon thousands of different species of snakes all over the world, how
//could they all use the __same__ version of their supposed language,
//“Parseltongue”?

// 8832
//Of course that was all merely common sense, in which Harry was starting to lose
//faith entirely.

// 8833
//But Harry was sure he’d heard snakes hissing on the TV at some point - after
//all, he knew what that sounded like from __somewhere__ - and __that__
//hadn’t sounded to him like language, which had seemed a good deal more
//reassuring…

// 8834
//…at first. The problem was that Draco had also asserted that Parselmouths could
//send snakes on extended complex missions. And if that was true, then
//Parselmouths had to __make snakes persistently intelligent__ by talking to
//them. In the worst-case scenario that would make the snake self-aware, like
//what Harry had accidentally done to the Sorting Hat.

// 8835
//And when Harry had offered __that__ hypothesis, Draco had claimed that he
//could remember a story - Harry hoped to Cthulhu that __this one__ story
//was just a fairy tale, it had that ring to it, but there __was __a story -
//about Salazar Slytherin sending a brave young viper on a mission to
//__gather information from other snakes.__

// 8836
//If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make __other __snakes
//self-aware by talking to __them,__ then…

// 8837
//Then…

// 8838
//Harry didn’t even know why his mind was going all “then… then…” when he knew
//perfectly well how the exponential progression would work, it was just the
//sheer moral horror of it that was blowing his mind.

// 8839
//And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to cows?

// 8840
//What if there were Poultrymouths?

// 8841
//Or for that matter…

// 8842
//Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots was about to
//enter his mouth.

// 8843
//__That couldn’t, couldn’t possibly be true, surely no wizard would be
//stupid enough to do THAT…__

// 8844
//And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that __of course__ they
//would be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had probably never considered the moral
//implications of snake intelligence for even one second, just like it hadn’t
//ever occurred to Salazar that __Muggleborns__ were intelligent enough to
//deserve personhood rights. Most people just didn’t see moral issues at all
//unless someone else was pointing them out…

// 8845
//“Harry?” said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid he would
//regret asking. “Why are you staring at your fork like that?”

// 8846
//“I’m starting to think magic should be illegal,” said Harry. “By the way, have
//you ever heard any stories about wizards who could speak with plants?”

// 8847
//Terry hadn’t heard of anything like that.

// 8848
//Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had asked.

// 8849
//And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down again, staring at
//his plate of vegetables with a forlorn expression. He was getting hungrier, and
//later in the day he would be visiting Mary’s Place for one of their incredibly
//tasty dishes… Harry was finding himself sorely tempted to just revert back to
//yesterday’s eating habits and be done with it.

// 8850
//__You’ve got to eat something,__ said his inner Slytherin.__ And
//it’s not all that much __more__ likely that anyone sneezed self-awareness
//onto poultry than onto plants, so as long as you’re eating food of questionable
//sentience either way, why not eat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?__

// 8851
//__I’m not quite sure that’s valid utilitarian logic, there -__

// 8852
//__Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian logic coming
//up: Even in the unlikely chance that some moron __did__ manage to confer
//sentience on chickens, it’s __your__ research that stands the best chance
//of discovering the fact and doing something about it. If you can complete your
//work even slightly faster by __not__ messing around with your diet, then,
//counterintuitive as it may seem, the __best__ thing you can do to save the
//greatest number of possibly-sentient who-knows-whats is __not__ wasting
//time on wild guesses about what might be intelligent. It’s not like the house
//elves haven’t prepared the food already, regardless of what you take onto your
//plate.__

// 8853
//Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive line of reasoning
//-

// 8854
//__Good! __said Slytherin. __I’m glad you see now that the most moral
//thing to do is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings for your own
//convenience, to feed your dreadful appetites, for the sick pleasure of ripping
//them apart with your teeth -__

// 8855
//__What?__ Harry thought indignantly. __Which side are you
//__on__ here?__

// 8856
//His inner Slytherin’s mental voice was grim. __You too will someday
//embrace the doctrine… that the end justifies the meats.__ This was followed by
//some mental snickering.

// 8857
//Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be sentient, his
//non-Ravenclaw components had been having trouble taking his moral caution
//seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting __Cannibalism!__ every time Harry tried
//to think about any food item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would visualize it
//screaming while he ate it, even if it was, say, a sandwich -

// 8858
//__Cannibalism!__

// 8859
//__AIIIEEEE DON’T EAT ME -__

// 8860
//__Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It’s a safe place to compromise your
//ethics in the service of higher goals, everyone __else__ thinks it’s okay
//to eat sandwiches so you can’t use your usual rationalization about a small
//probability of a large downside if you get caught -__

// 8861
//Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, __Just so long as you’re okay with
//__us__ being eaten by giant monsters that didn’t do enough research into
//whether __we__ were sentient.__

// 8862
//__I’m okay with that,__ said Slytherin. __Is everyone else okay with
//that?__ (Internal mental nods.) __Great, can we go back to deep-fried
//Diracawl slices now?__

// 8863
//__Not until I’ve done some more research into what’s sentient and what
//isn’t. Now shut up.__ And Harry turned firmly away from his plate full of
//oh-so-tempting vegetables to head toward the library -

// 8864
//__Just eat the students,__ said Hufflepuff. __There’s no doubt about
//whether __they’re__ sentient.__

// 8865
//__You know you want to,__ said Gryffindor. __I bet the young ones
//are the tastiest.__

// 8866
//Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged their
//imaginary personalities.

// 8867
//“__Honestly__,” said Hermione. The young girl’s voice sounded a little
//acerbic as her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the Herbology stacks in the
//Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a message asking if she could come to the
//library after she’d finished breakfast, which Harry had skipped; but then when
//Harry had introduced the day’s topic she’d seemed a bit nonplussed. “You know
//your problem, Harry? You’ve got no sense of priorities. An idea gets into your
//head and you just go running straight off after it.”

// 8868
//“I’ve got a __great__ sense of priorities,” said Harry. His hand reached
//out and grabbed __Vegetable Cunning__ by Casey McNamara, and began to flip
//through the starting pages, searching for the table of contents. “That’s why I
//want to find out whether plants can talk __before__ I eat my carrots.”

// 8869
//“Don’t you think that maybe the two of us have more __important__ things
//to worry about?”

// 8870
//__You sound just like Draco,__ Harry thought, but of course didn’t say out
//loud. Out loud he said, “What could __possibly__ be more important than
//plants turning out to be sentient?”

// 8871
//There was a pregnant silence from beside him, as Harry’s eyes went down the
//table of contents. There was indeed a chapter on Plant Language, causing
//Harry’s heart to skip a beat; and then his hands began to rapidly turn the
//pages, heading for the appropriate page number.

// 8872
//“There are days,” said Hermione Granger, “when I really, truly, have absolutely
//no idea what goes on inside that head of yours.”

// 8873
//“Look, it’s a question of multiplication, okay? There’s a __lot__ of
//plants in the world, if they’re __not__ sentient then they’re not
//important, but if plants __are__ people then they’ve got more moral weight
//than all the human beings in the world put together. Now, of course your brain
//doesn’t realize that on an intuitive level, but that’s because the brain can’t
//multiply. Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much
//they’ll pay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousand
//birds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively state that
//they’re willing to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No
//difference, in other words. It’s called scope insensitivity. Your brain
//imagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image creates some
//amount of emotion that determines your willingness to pay. But no one can
//visualize even two thousand of anything, so the __quantity__ just gets
//thrown straight out the window. Now try to __correct__ that bias with
//respect to a __hundred trillion__ sentient blades of grass, and you’ll
//realize that this could be thousands of times more important than we used to
//think the whole human species was… oh thank Azathoth, this says it’s just
//mandrakes that can talk and they speak regular human language out loud, not
//that there’s a spell you can use to talk with __any__ plant -”

// 8874
//“Ron came to me at breakfast yesterday morning,” Hermione said. Now her voice
//sounded a little quiet, a little sad, maybe even a little scared. “He said he’d
//been dreadfully shocked to see me kiss you. That what you said while you were
//Demented should’ve shown me how much evil you were hiding inside. And that if I
//was going to be a follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn’t sure he wanted to
//be in my army anymore.”

// 8875
//Harry’s hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that Harry’s brain, for all
//its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of appreciating scope on any real
//emotional level, because it had just forcibly redirected his attention away
//from trillions of possibly-sentient blades of grass who might be suffering or
//dying even as they spoke, and toward the life of a single human being who
//happened to be nearer and dearer.

// 8876
//“Ron is the world’s most gigantic prat,” Harry said. “They won’t be printing
//that in the newspaper anytime soon, because it’s not news. So after you fired
//him, how many of his arms and legs did you break?”

// 8877
//“I tried to tell him it wasn’t like that,” Hermione went on in the same quiet
//voice. “I tried to tell him __you__ weren’t like that, and that it wasn’t
//like that between the two of us, but it just seemed to make him even more… more
//like he was.”

// 8878
//“Well, yes,” Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn’t feeling angrier at
//Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to be overriding that, for
//now. “The more you try to justify yourself to people like that, the more it
//acknowledges that they have the __right__ to question you. It shows you
//think they get to be your inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of
//power over you, they just push more and more.” This was one of Draco Malfoy’s
//lessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people who
//__tried__ to defend themselves got questioned over every little point and
//could never satisfy their interrogators; but if you made it clear from the
//start that you were a celebrity and above social conventions, people’s minds
//wouldn’t bother tracking most violations. “That’s why when Ron came over to
//__me__ as I was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay
//away from you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, ‘You see how high
//I’m holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this high to talk to
//me.’ Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into the darkness, unquote, so I
//pursed my lips and went __schluuuuurp__, and after that his mouth was
//still making those talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don’t think
//he’ll be trying his lectures on me again.”

// 8879
//“I understand why you did that,” Hermione said, her voice tight, “I
//__wanted__ to tell him off too, but I really wish you hadn’t, it will make
//things harder for __me,__ Harry!”

// 8880
//Harry looked up from __Vegetable Cunning__ again, he wasn’t getting any
//reading done at this rate; and he saw that Hermione was still reading whatever
//book she had, not looking up at him. Her hands turned another page even as he
//watched.

// 8881
//“I think you’re taking the wrong approach by trying to defend yourself at all,”
//Harry said. “I really do think that. You are who you are. You’re friends with
//whoever you choose. Tell anyone who questions you to shove it.”

// 8882
//Hermione just shook her head, and turned another page.

// 8883
//“Option two,” Harry said. “Go to Fred and George and tell them to have a little
//talk with their wayward brother, __those__ two are genuine good guys -”

// 8884
//“It’s not just Ron,” Hermione said in almost a whisper. “Lots of people are
//saying it, Harry. Even Mandy is giving me worried looks when she thinks I’m not
//looking. Isn’t it funny? I keep worrying that Professor Quirrell is sucking
//__you__ into the darkness, and now people are warning me just the same way
//I try to warn you.”

// 8885
//“Well, __yeah,__” said Harry. “Doesn’t that reassure you a bit about me
//and Professor Quirrell?”

// 8886
//“In a word,” said Hermione, “no.”

// 8887
//There was a silence that lasted long enough for Hermione to turn another page,
//and then her voice, in a real whisper this time, “And, and Padma is going
//around telling everyone that, that since I couldn’t cast the P-Patronus Charm,
//I must only be p-pretending to be n-nice…”

// 8888
//“Padma didn’t even __try __herself!” Harry said indignantly. “If you
//__were__ a Dark Witch who was just pretending, you wouldn’t have
//__tried__ in front of everyone, do they think you’re __stupid?__”

// 8889
//Hermione smiled a little, and blinked a few times.

// 8890
//“Hey, __I__ have to worry about __actually__ going evil.
//__Here__ the worst case scenario is that people think you’re more evil
//than you really are. Is that going to kill you? I mean, is it all __that__
//bad?”

// 8891
//The young girl nodded, her face screwed up tight.

// 8892
//“Look, Hermione… if you worry that much about what other people think, if
//you’re unhappy whenever other people don’t picture you exactly the same way you
//picture yourself, that’s __already__ dooming yourself to always be
//unhappy. No one ever thinks of us just the same way we think of ourselves.”

// 8893
//“I don’t know how to explain to you,” Hermione said in a sad soft voice. “I’m
//not sure it’s something you could ever understand, Harry. All I can think of to
//say is, how would you feel if __I__ thought you were evil?”

// 8894
//“Um…” Harry visualized it. “Yeah, that __would__ hurt. A lot. But you’re a
//good person who thinks about that sort of thing intelligently, you’ve
//__earned__ that power over me, it would __mean__ something if you
//thought I’d gone wrong. I can’t think of a single other student, besides you,
//whose opinion I’d care about the same way -”

// 8895
//“You can live like that,” whispered Hermione Granger. “I can’t.”

// 8896
//The girl had gone through another three pages in silence, and Harry had
//returned his eyes to his own book and was trying to regain his focus, when
//Hermione finally said, in a small voice, “Are you really sure I mustn’t know
//how to cast the Patronus Charm?”

// 8897
//“I…” Harry had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat. He suddenly saw himself
//__not__ knowing why the Patronus Charm didn’t work for him, __not__
//being able to show Draco, just being told that there was a reason, and nothing
//more. “Hermione, your Patronus would shine with the same light but it wouldn’t
//be __normal,__ it wouldn’t look like people think Patronuses should look,
//anyone who saw it would know there was something strange going on. Even if I
//told you the secret you couldn’t __demonstrate__ to anyone, unless you
//made them face the other way so they could only see the light, and… and the
//most important part of any secret is the knowledge that a secret exists, you
//could only show one or two friends if you swore them to secrecy…” Harry’s voice
//trailed off helplessly.

// 8898
//“I’ll take it.” Her voice was still small.

// 8899
//It was very hard not to just blurt out the secret, right there in the library.

// 8900
//“I, I shouldn’t, I __really__ shouldn’t, it’s __dangerous,__
//Hermione, it could do a lot of harm if that secret got out! Haven’t you heard
//the saying, three can keep a secret if two are dead? That telling just your
//closest friends is the same as telling everyone, because you’re not just
//trusting them, you’re trusting everyone they trust? It’s too important, too
//much of a risk, it’s not the sort of decision that should be made for the sake
//of fixing someone’s reputation at school!”

// 8901
//“Okay,” Hermione said. She closed the book and put it back on the shelf. “I
//can’t concentrate right now, Harry, I’m sorry.”

// 8902
//“If there’s __anything__ else I can do -”

// 8903
//“Be nicer to everyone.”

// 8904
//The girl didn’t look back as she walked out of the stacks, which might have
//been a good thing, because the boy was frozen in place, unmoving.

// 8905
//After a while, the boy started turning pages again.
