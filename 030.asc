//== Working in Groups, Pt 1

// 6198
//J. K. Rowling if a man tries to bother you, you can think blue, count two, and
//look for a red shoe.

// 6199
//The day was Sunday, November 3rd, and soon the three great powers of their
//school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and Hermione Granger, would begin
//their struggle for supreme dominance.

// 6200
//(Harry was slightly annoyed by the way the Boy-Who-Lived had been demoted from
//supreme dominance to one of three equal rivals just by entering the contest,
//but he expected to get it back soon.)

// 6201
//The battleground was a section of non-Forbidden forest, dense with trees,
//because Professor Quirrell thought that being able to see all the enemy forces
//was too boring even for your very first battle.

// 6202
//All the students who were not actually __in__ a first-year army were
//camped out nearby and watching on screens that Professor Quirrell had set up.
//Except for three Gryffindors in their fourth year, who were currently sick and
//confined to healer’s beds by Madam Pomfrey. Aside from that, everyone was
//there.

// 6203
//The students were dressed, not in their ordinary school robes, but in Muggle
//camouflage uniforms that Professor Quirrell had obtained somewhere and supplied
//in sufficient quantity and variety to fit everyone. It wasn’t that students
//would have worried about stains and rips, that was what Charms were for. But as
//Professor Quirrell had explained to the surprised wizardborns, nice dignified
//clothing was not efficient for hiding in forests or dodging around trees.

// 6204
//And on each uniform’s breast, a patch bearing the name and insignia of your
//army. A __small__ patch. If you wanted your soldiers to wear, say, colored
//ribbons so that they could identify each other at a distance, and risk the
//enemy getting their hands on the ribbons, that was all up to you.

// 6205
//Harry had tried to get the name Dragon Army.

// 6206
//Draco had pitched a fit and said that would confuse everyone completely.

// 6207
//Professor Quirrell had ruled that Draco could lay prior claim to the name, if
//he wished.

// 6208
//So now Harry was fighting Dragon Army.

// 6209
//This probably wasn’t a good sign.

// 6210
//For their insignia, instead of the too-obvious dragon’s head breathing fire,
//Draco had elected to simply go with the fire. Elegant, understated, deadly:
//__This is what’s left after we’ve passed.__ Very Malfoy.

// 6211
//Harry, after considering alternate choices such as the 501st Provisional
//Battalion and Harry’s Minions o’ Doom, had decided that his army would be known
//by the simple and dignified appellation of the Chaos Legion.

// 6212
//Their insignia was a hand poised with fingers ready to snap.

// 6213
//It was __universally__ agreed that this wasn’t a good sign.

// 6214
//Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving under her were
//probably nervous about her being a girl with a reputation for being nice, and
//that she should pick something scary that would reassure them of her toughness
//and make them proud to be part of her army, like the Blood Commandos or
//something.

// 6215
//Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.

// 6216
//Their insignia was a smiley face.

// 6217
//And in ten minutes, they would be at war.

// 6218
//Harry stood in the bright forest clearing that was their assigned starting
//location, an area of open space with old and rotting tree stumps that had been
//cleared away for some unknown purpose, ground coated with a small scattering of
//blown leaves and the dried grey remnants of grass that had failed the test of
//summer’s heat, and the sun shining down brilliantly from above.

// 6219
//Around him were the twenty-three soldiers that Professor Quirrell had assigned
//to him. Nearly all of Gryffindor had signed up, of course, and more than half
//of Slytherin, and less than half of Hufflepuff, and a handful of Ravenclaw. In
//Harry’s army there were twelve Gryffindors and six Slytherins and four
//Hufflepuffs and one Ravenclaw besides himself… not that there was any way to
//tell that by looking at the uniforms. No red, no green, no yellow, no blue.
//Just Muggle camouflage patterns, and a patch on the breast with the device of a
//hand poised to snap its fingers.

// 6220
//Harry looked upon his twenty-three soldiers, all wearing the same uniforms with
//no marks of group identity save that single patch.

// 6221
//And lo, Harry smiled, because he understood what this part of Professor
//Quirrell’s master plan was about; and Harry was taking full advantage of it for
//his __own__ purposes, too.

// 6222
//There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the Robbers Cave
//experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered aftermath of World War II,
//with the intent of investigating the causes and remedies of conflicts between
//groups. The scientists had set up a summer camp for 22 boys from 22 different
//schools, selecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The first
//phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what it took to
//__start__ a conflict between groups. The 22 boys had been divided into two
//groups of 11 -

// 6223
//- and this had been quite sufficient.

// 6224
//The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had become aware of
//each others’ existences in the state park, insults being hurled on the first
//meeting. They’d named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers (they hadn’t
//needed names for themselves when they thought they were the only ones in the
//park) and had proceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers
//thinking of themselves as rough-and-tough and swearing heavily, the Eagles
//correspondingly deciding to think of themselves as upright-and-proper.

// 6225
//The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolve group
//conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks hadn’t worked at all.
//They’d just shouted at each other and stayed apart. What __had__ worked
//was warning them that there might be vandals in the park, and the two groups
//needing to work together to solve a failure of the park’s water system. A
//common task, a common enemy.

// 6226
//Harry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood this principle
//very well indeed when he had chosen to create __three__ armies per year.

// 6227
//__Three__ armies.

// 6228
//Not __four__.

// 6229
//And definitely __not__ segregated by House… except that no Slytherins had
//been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle.

// 6230
//It was things like this which reassured Harry that Professor Quirrell, despite
//his affected Dark atmosphere and his pretense of neutrality in the conflict
//between Good and Evil, was secretly backing Good, not that Harry would ever
//dare say that out loud.

// 6231
//And Harry had decided to take full advantage of Professor Quirrell’s plan to
//define a group identity __his__ way.

// 6232
//The Rattlers, once they’d met the Eagles, had started thinking of themselves as
//rough-and-tough, and they’d conducted themselves accordingly.

// 6233
//The Eagles had thought of themselves as good-and-proper.

// 6234
//And in that bright forest clearing, scattered around the old and rotting tree
//stumps, outlined in the sun shining down brilliantly from above, General Potter
//and his twenty-three soldiers were arranged in nothing remotely resembling a
//formation. Some soldiers stood, some soldiers sat, some stood on one leg just
//to be different.

// 6235
//It was the __Chaos__ Legion, after all.

// 6236
//And if there wasn’t a __reason__ to stand in neat little lines, Harry had
//said disdainfully, there weren’t going to be neat little lines.

// 6237
//Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each, each squad
//commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under strict orders to disobey
//any orders they were given if it seemed like a good idea at the time, including
//that one… unless Harry or the Squad Suggester prefixed the order with “Merlin
//says”, in which case you were supposed to actually obey.

// 6238
//The Chaos Legion’s chief attack was to split up and run in from multiple
//directions, randomly changing vectors and firing the approved sleep spell as
//rapidly as you could rebuild the magical strength. And if you saw a chance to
//distract or confuse the enemy, you took it.

// 6239
//Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don’t just obey orders, think
//about whether what you’re doing __right now__ makes sense.

// 6240
//Harry wasn’t quite as sure as he’d pretended that this was the optimum of
//military efficiency… but he’d been given a golden opportunity to change how
//some students __thought about themselves,__ and that was how he intended
//to use it.

// 6241
//Five minutes to wartime, according to Harry’s watch.

// 6242
//General Potter walked (not marched) over to where his air force was waiting
//tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly in their hands.

// 6243
//“All wings report in,” said General Potter. They’d rehearsed this during their
//one training session on Saturday.

// 6244
//“Red Leader standing by,” said Seamus Finnigan, who had no idea what it meant.

// 6245
//“Red Five standing by,” said Dean Thomas, who’d waited his entire life to say
//it.

// 6246
//“Green Leader standing by,” Theodore Nott said rather stiffly.

// 6247
//“Green Forty-One standing by,” Tracey Davis said.

// 6248
//“I want you in the air the instant we hear the bell,” said General Potter. “Do
//not engage, repeat, do not engage. Evade if under fire.” (Of course you did
//__not__ aim sleep spells at broomsticks; you fired a spell that gave a
//temporary red glow to whatever it hit. If you hit the broomstick or the rider,
//they were out of the war.) “Red Leader and Red Five, fly toward Malfoy’s army
//as fast as you can, stay as high as you can while still seeing them, return the
//instant you know for sure what they’re doing. Green Leader, do the same for
//Granger’s army. Green Forty-One, fly above us and watch for any approaching
//broomsticks or soldiers, you and only you are authorized to fire. And remember,
//I didn’t say ‘Merlin says’ for any of that, but we __do__ really need the
//information. For Chaos!”

// 6249
//“For Chaos!” the four echoed with varying degrees of enthusiasm.

// 6250
//Harry expected Hermione to launch an immediate attack on Draco, in which case
//he’d move his troops into position and start supporting her, but only after
//she’d taken severe losses and caused some damage. He would frame it as a heroic
//rescue, if possible; it wouldn’t do to have Sunshine thinking that Chaos wasn’t
//their friend, after all.

// 6251
//But just in case she __didn’t__… well, that was why the Chaos Legion was
//staying put until Green Leader reported back.

// 6252
//Draco’s moves would be in his own self-interest. He would predictably ready his
//army to defend against Hermione; he might or might not realize that Harry had
//been lying about waiting to attack until after that battle finished. Harry had
//still put two broomsticks on Dragon Army, just in case they __were__ doing
//something, and just in case Draco or Mr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe was good enough to
//shoot a broomstick out of the sky.

// 6253
//But General Granger was the unpredictable one, and Harry couldn’t move until he
//knew how she was moving.

// 6254
//In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the ground as leafy
//canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood where the trees were
//relatively sparser, and looked out on his troops with calm satisfaction. Six
//units of three troops each, the Aerial Unit of four (to which Gregory was
//assigned), and the Command Unit, which was himself and Vincent. They’d only
//drilled for a short time on the previous Saturday, but Draco was confident that
//he’d managed to explain the basics. Stay with your mates, watch their back and
//trust them to watch yours. Move as a single body. Obey orders and show no fear.
//Aim, fire, move, aim again, fire again.

// 6255
//The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around Draco, watchfully
//gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they stood, wands gripped low
//until they needed to strike.

// 6256
//They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose training Draco had
//watched during his father’s inspections.

// 6257
//Chaos and Sunshine weren’t going to know what hit them.

// 6258
//“Attention,” said General Malfoy.

// 6259
//The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his broomstick
//riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks already in hand.

// 6260
//Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they won their first
//battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be more willing to salute a
//Malfoy.

// 6261
//But his soldiers were already standing straight enough, especially the
//Gryffindors, that Draco wondered if he’d even needed to delay. Gregory had
//quietly listened, and reported back that Draco’s volunteering to stand by Harry
//Potter in Defense class, that time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how
//to lose, had marked Draco as an acceptable commander. At least if you happened
//to be assigned to his army. __Not all Slytherins are alike; there are
//Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins__ was what the Gryffindors in Draco’s
//army were quoting to their Housemates.

// 6262
//Draco was frankly __astounded__ at how incredibly __easy__ that had
//been. Draco had protested at first about not being assigned any Slytherins, and
//Professor Quirrell had told him that if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to
//gain complete political control of the country, he needed to learn how to
//govern the other three-quarters of the population. It was things like this
//which reassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great deal more sympathy
//for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting on.

// 6263
//The actual battle wouldn’t be easy, especially if Granger did attack the
//Dragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit all his forces against
//Granger immediately in a preemptive strike, but had worried that (1) Harry had
//been misleading him completely about what Granger was likely to do, and (2)
//Harry had been misleading him about waiting until after Granger’s attack to
//join the battle.

// 6264
//Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact, which might be
//enough to win even if they were attacked by both armies at once…

// 6265
//It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the pre-battle speech that
//Draco had composed and memorized.

// 6266
//“The battle is about to begin,” Draco said. His voice was calm and precise.
//“Remember everything that I and Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle showed you. An army
//wins because it is disciplined and deadly. General Potter and the Chaos Legion
//will not be disciplined. Granger and the Sunshine Regiment will not be deadly.
//We are disciplined, we are deadly, we are Dragons. The battle is about to
//begin, and we are about to win it.”

// 6267
//__(Ex tempore speech given by General Potter to the Chaos Legion,
//immediately before their first battle, on November 3rd, 1991, at 2:56pm:)__

// 6268
//My troops, I’m not going to lie to you, our situation today is very grim.
//Dragon Army has never lost a single battle. And Hermione Granger… has a very
//good memory. The truth is, most of you are probably going to die. And the
//survivors will envy the dead. But we have to win this. We have to win this so
//that someday, our children can enjoy the taste of chocolate again. Everything
//is at stake here. Literally everything. If we lose, the whole universe just
//blinks out like a light bulb. And now I realize that most of you don’t know
//what a light bulb is. Well, take it from me, it’s bad. But if we have to go
//down, let’s go down fighting, like heroes, so that as the darkness closes in,
//we can think to ourselves, __at least we had fun.__ Are you afraid to die?
//I know I am. I can feel those cold shivers of fear like someone is pumping ice
//cream into my shirt. But I know… that history is watching us. It was watching
//us when we changed into our uniforms. It was probably taking pictures. And
//history, my troops, is written by the victors. If we win this, we can write our
//own history. A history in which Hogwarts was founded by four renegade house
//elves. We can make everyone study that history, even though it isn’t true, and
//if they don’t answer the right way on our tests… they’ll fail the class. Isn’t
//that worth dying for? No, don’t answer that. Some things are better left
//unknown. None of us know why we’re here. None of us know why we’re fighting. We
//just woke up in these uniforms in this mysterious forest, knowing only that
//there was no way to get our names and memories back except victory. The
//students in those other armies out there… they’re just like us. They don’t want
//to die. They’re fighting to protect each other, the only friends they have
//left. They’re fighting because they know they have families who’ll miss them,
//even if they can’t remember now. They may even be fighting to save the world.
//But we have a better reason to fight than they do. We fight because we like it.
//We fight to amuse eldritch monstrosities from beyond Space and Time. We fight
//because we’re Chaos. Soon the final battle will begin, so let me say now,
//because I won’t get a chance later, that it was an honor to be your commander,
//however briefly. Thank you, thank you all. And remember, your goal isn’t just
//to cut down the enemy, it’s to make them afraid.

// 6269
//A great booming gong echoed over the forest.

// 6270
//And the Sunshine Regiment began to march.

// 6271
//The tension rose and rose, as Harry and the nineteen other soldiers who
//remained waited for the aerial warriors to report back. It shouldn’t take long,
//broomsticks were fast and the distances in the forest were not great -

// 6272
//Two broomsticks approached, at speed, from the direction of Draco’s camp, and
//all the soldiers tensed. They weren’t executing the maneuvers that were today’s
//code for a __friendly__ broomstick.

// 6273
//“__Scatter and fire!__” roared General Potter, and then suited action to
//words, scurrying off at top speed toward the forest cover; and then as soon as
//Harry was among the trees, he spun back, raised his wand, tried to seek out the
//broomstick in the sky -

// 6274
//“Clear!” shouted a voice. “They’re heading back!”

// 6275
//Harry gave a mental shrug. There’d been no way to prevent Draco from obtaining
//that information, and he’d only learn that they’d been standing still.

// 6276
//And the Chaotics slowly emerged from the forest -

// 6277
//“Broomstick approaching from Granger’s direction!” yelled another voice. “I
//think it’s Green Leader, he did the dip and roll!”

// 6278
//Moments later Theodore Nott dived out of the sky and pulled up in the midst of
//the soldiers.

// 6279
//“Granger has divided her forces in two!” yelled Nott as he hovered on his
//broomstick. There was sweat staining his uniform, and all the reserve was gone
//from his voice. “She’s attacking both armies! Two brooms covering each force,
//they pursued me halfway here!”

// 6280
//__Divided her army, what on Earth -__

// 6281
//A large force concentrating fire on a small force could deplete that force
//rapidly without taking much damage in return. If twenty soldiers faced ten
//soldiers, twenty sleep spells would be aimed at the ten soldiers with only ten
//sleep spells going the other way, so unless every one of those first sleep
//spells hit its target, the smaller force would lose more people than they could
//manage to take down with them. __Defeated in detail__ was the military
//term for what happened when you divided your forces like that. What could
//Hermione __possibly__ be thinking…

// 6282
//Then Harry realized.

// 6283
//__She’s being fair.__

// 6284
//It was going to be a long year in Defense class.

// 6285
//“All right,” Harry said loudly, so the army could hear. “We’ll wait until the
//Red Wing reports in, and then we’ll go cloud up some Sunshine.”

// 6286
//Draco listened to the flyers’ reports with his face calm, all his shock
//concealed inside. What could Granger __possibly__ be thinking?

// 6287
//Then Draco realized.

// 6288
//__It’s a feint.__

// 6289
//One of Sunshine’s two forces would change direction, and both would converge
//on… who?

// 6290
//Neville Longbottom marched through the forest toward the approaching Sunny
//force, occasionally glancing up at the sky for broomsticks. Beside him marched
//his squad comrades, Melvin Coote and Lavender Brown of Gryffindor, and Allen
//Flint of Slytherin. Allen Flint was their Squad Suggester, though Harry had
//first said to Neville, in private, that the position was his if he wanted it.

// 6291
//Harry had said quite a lot of things to Neville in private, starting with “You
//know, Neville, if you want to become as awesome as the imaginary Neville who
//lives in your head but isn’t allowed to do anything because you’re scared, then
//you really should sign up for Professor Quirrell’s armies.”

// 6292
//Neville was now __sure__ the Boy-Who-Lived could read minds. There was
//just no other way Harry Potter could’ve known. Neville had never talked about
//that with __anyone__, or given any sign; and __other__ people weren’t
//like that, not that Neville had ever noticed.

// 6293
//And Harry’s promise had come true, this __did__ feel different from
//sparring in Defense class. Neville had hoped that sparring would fix everything
//that was wrong with him, and, well, it hadn’t. Even if he could fire a few
//spells at another student in class with Professor Quirrell watching to make
//sure nothing went wrong, even if he could dodge and fire back when it was
//__allowed__ and everyone else was __expecting__ it and they would
//stare at him funny if he __didn’t__ do it, none of that was the same as
//being able to stand up for himself.

// 6294
//But being part of an __army…__

// 6295
//Something strange was stirring inside Neville, as he marched through the forest
//alongside his comrades, upon their uniforms an insignia of fingers poised to
//snap.

// 6296
//He was allowed to walk if he wanted to, but he just felt like marching.

// 6297
//Beside him, Melvin and Lavender and Allen all seemed to feel like marching too.

// 6298
//And Neville softly began to sing the Song of Chaos.

// 6299
//The tune was what a Muggle would have identified as John Williams’s Imperial
//March, also known as “Darth Vader’s Theme”; and the words Harry had added were
//easy to remember.

// 6300
//__Doom doom doom__

// 6301
//__Doom doom doom doom doom doom__

// 6302
//__Doom doom doom__

// 6303
//__Doom doom doom doom doom doom__

// 6304
//__DOOM doom DOOM__

// 6305
//__Doom doom doom-doom-doom doom doom__

// 6306
//__Doom doom-doom-doom doom doom__

// 6307
//__Doom doom doom, doom doom doom.__

// 6308
//By the second line the others had joined in, and soon you could hear the same
//soft chant coming from nearby parts of the forest.

// 6309
//And Neville marched alongside his fellow Chaos Legionnaires,

// 6310
//strange feelings stirring in his heart,

// 6311
//imagination becoming reality,

// 6312
//as from his lips poured a fearful song of doom.

// 6313
//Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest. Something inside him
//felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind himself hard that they were only
//sleeping. There were girls among the fallen, and that made it a lot worse
//somehow, and he would have to be careful never to mention that in front of
//Hermione or the Aurors would find his remains stuffed into a __small__
//teapot.

// 6314
//Half of Sunshine army hadn’t put up much of a fight against all of Chaos. The
//nine ground soldiers had run in screaming inarticulately with Simple Shields
//raised, circular screens to protect their faces and chests. But you couldn’t
//fire and hold the shield at the same time, and Harry’s soldiers had simply
//aimed for the legs. All but one of the Sunnies had fallen over as soon as the
//cries of “__Somnium!__” filled the air. That last one had dropped her
//shield and managed to take out one of Harry’s soldiers before being hit by the
//second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex was safe for multiple hits). The two
//Sunny broomsticks had been much harder to take down and had accounted for three
//Chaotics before being auraed by massed ground fire.

// 6315
//Hermione wasn’t among the fallen. Draco must have gotten her and that was
//making Harry feel __angry__ on some completely incomprehensible level, he
//wasn’t sure if he was feeling protective toward Hermione, or cheated that he
//hadn’t been the one to do it, or maybe __both.__

// 6316
//“All right,” Harry said, raising his voice. “Let’s everyone be clear on one
//thing, that wasn’t a real fight. That was General Granger making a mistake in
//her first battle. Today’s actual fight is with Dragon Army and it’s not going
//to be anything like this. It’s going to be a lot more fun. Let’s move out.”

// 6317
//A broomstick fell out of the sky, approaching terrifyingly fast, and spun on
//its end and decelerated so hard you could almost hear the air screaming in
//protest, and came to a halt directly beside Draco.

// 6318
//It wasn’t dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply __was__ that good
//and he didn’t waste time.

// 6319
//“Potter’s coming,” Gregory said with no trace of his usual fake drawl. “They’ve
//still got all four of their brooms, you want me to take them out?”

// 6320
//“No,” Draco said sharply. “Fighting over their army gives them too much of an
//advantage, they’ll fire on you from the ground and even you might not be able
//to dodge it all. Wait until the forces engage.”

// 6321
//Draco had lost four Dragons in exchange for twelve Sunnies. Apparently General
//Granger actually __had__ been that incredibly stupid, though she hadn’t
//been among the attackers, so Draco hadn’t gotten a chance to taunt her or ask
//her what in Merlin’s name she had been thinking.

// 6322
//The true battle, they all knew, would be with Harry Potter.

// 6323
//“Prepare yourselves!” roared Draco at his troops. “Stay together with your
//mates, act as a unit, fire as soon as the enemy is in range!”

// 6324
//Discipline against Chaos.

// 6325
//It shouldn’t be much of a fight.

// 6326
//The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville’s blood until he felt like
//he could hardly breathe.

// 6327
//“We’re closing in,” said General Potter in a voice barely loud enough to carry
//to the whole army. “Time to spread out.”

// 6328
//Neville’s comrades moved away from him. They would still support each other,
//but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a much easier time hitting
//you; fire aimed at one of your comrades might miss and get you instead. You
//would be a lot harder to hit if you spread out and moved as fast as you could.

// 6329
//The first thing General Potter had done, during their training session, was get
//them to fire on each other when both sides were running fast, or both stood
//still and took time to aim, or one was moving and one was standing still - the
//reverse charm to the Sleep Hex was simple, though you weren’t allowed to use it
//during real battles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that
//happened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that it made
//more sense for them to focus, not on slowing down to aim carefully, but on
//moving fast so they wouldn’t get hit.

// 6330
//It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching side-by-side with his
//comrades, but the scary battlecries they’d learned were already thundering in
//his head and that made up for a lot.

// 6331
//This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was absolutely
//positively not going to squeak.

// 6332
//“Shields up,” said General Potter, “power to forward deflectors.”

// 6333
//“__Contego,__” murmured the army, and the circular screens sprang into
//existence before their heads and chests.

// 6334
//A sharp taste filled Neville’s mouth. General Potter wouldn’t have ordered them
//to cast shields unless they were almost in range. Neville could see the
//uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through the dense screens of trees, and the
//Dragons would be seeing them as well -

// 6335
//“__Attack!__” came a cry from the distance, the voice of Draco Malfoy, and
//General Potter bellowed, ”__Charge -__”

// 6336
//All the adrenaline in Neville’s blood was unleashed, and his legs took over,
//sending him flying faster than he’d ever run before, straight toward the enemy,
//knowing without needing to look that all his comrades were doing the same.

// 6337
//“__Blood for the blood god!__” screamed Neville. ”__Skulls for the
//skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy’s gate is sideways!__”

// 6338
//There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself against Neville’s
//shield. If there’d been other spells fired, they hadn’t hit.

// 6339
//Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins’s face, as he stood besides
//two Gryffindors Neville didn’t recognize, and then -

// 6340
//- Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne -

// 6341
//- missed -

// 6342
//- his racing legs went __straight__ past the enemy grouping and toward
  //another three Dragons, their wands coming up on him, their mouths opening -

// 6343
//- not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest floor just as
  //three voices cried “__Somnium!__”

// 6344
//It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he rolled, it
//wasn’t as bad as falling off his broomstick but he’d still hit the ground
//pretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden insight, lay still and closed his
//eyes.

// 6345
//“Stop that!” screamed a voice. “Don’t shoot us, we’re Dragons!”

// 6346
//With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that he’d managed to
//get between two groups of Dragons just as one group had fired on him. Harry had
//talked about this as a tactic for making the enemy afraid to fire, but
//apparently it worked a bit better than that.

// 6347
//And not only that, the Dragons believed they’d __gotten__ him, since
//they’d seen Neville fall just as they fired.

// 6348
//Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes a crack.

// 6349
//The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly as cries of
//“__Somnium!__” and __“Skulls for the skull throne!__” filled the air
//around them. All three had Simple Shields up now.

// 6350
//Neville’s wand was still in his hand, and it didn’t take much effort to point
//it at one boy’s boots and whisper “__Somnium.__”

// 6351
//Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard the boy fall
//to the ground.

// 6352
//“__Where’d it come from?__” screamed Justin Finch-Fletchley’s voice, and
//Neville heard rustles on the leafy forest floor, as of two Dragons spinning
//around looking for an enemy.

// 6353
//“__Reform ranks!__” bellowed Malfoy’s voice. ”__To me, everyone,
//don’t let them scatter you!__”

// 6354
//Neville’s ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his prone body as they
//ran off.

// 6355
//Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit painfully, and then
//pointed his wand and said the new charm that General Potter had taught them
//all. They couldn’t do real illusion spells to confuse the enemy, but even at
//their age they could -

// 6356
//“__Ventriliquo,__” whispered Neville, pointing the wand to one side of
//Justin and the other boy, and then yelled, ”__For Cthulhu and glory!__”

// 6357
//Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields toward where
//Neville had moved his battlecry, and that was when multiple cries of
//“__Somnium!__” filled the air and the other boy dropped before Neville was
//finished aiming.

// 6358
//“__The last one’s mine!__” yelled Neville, and then he started sprinting
//straight toward Justin, who’d been mean to him until the older Hufflepuffs
//straightened him out. Neville was surrounded by his comrades and __that__
//meant -

// 6359
//“__Special attack, Chaotic Leap!__” howled Neville as he ran, and felt his
//body lighten, then lighten twice again, as his comrades got their wands turned
//toward him and quietly cast the Hover Charm, and Neville raised his left hand
//and snapped his fingers and then used his legs to push off the ground as hard
//as he could and __soared__ through the air. Sheer shock painted Justin’s
//face as Neville went __over__ the other boy’s shield and pointed his wand
//down at the form passing beneath him and cried ”__Somnium!__”

// 6360
//Because he’d felt like it, that was why.

// 6361
//Neville didn’t quite get his feet turned around properly and rather plowed into
//the ground as he landed, but two out of three of the other Chaos Legionnaires
//had managed to hold their wands on him throughout and he didn’t hit very hard.

// 6362
//And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be moving, people were
//yelling “Somnium!” all over the place -

// 6363
//“__I am Neville, the last scion of Longbottom!__” screamed Neville to the
//sky above, holding his wand pointed straight up as though to challenge the
//blazing blue heaven itself, knowing that nothing after this day would ever be
//the same again. ”__Neville of Chaos! Face me if you da-__”

// 6364
//(When Neville woke up afterward, he was told that Dragon Army had taken this as
//their cue to counterattack.)

// 6365
//The girl beside Harry slumped to the ground, taking the shot meant for him, and
//he could hear Mr. Goyle’s distant gloating laugh as his broomstick blasted past
//them, cutting the air so hard it should have shattered in his wake.

// 6366
//“__Luminos!__” cried one of the boys next to Harry, who hadn’t been able
//to rebuild the magical strength fast enough to do it earlier, and Mr. Goyle
//dodged it without a pause.

// 6367
//Chaos had only six soldiers left, now, and Dragon Army had two, and the only
//problem was that one of those soldiers was invincible, and the other one was
//using up three soldiers just to cover him inside his shield.

// 6368
//They’d lost more soldiers to Mr. Goyle than all the other Dragons put together,
//he was weaving and dodging through the air so fast that no one could hit him,
//and he could __shoot people while he did that.__

// 6369
//Harry had thought of all sorts of ways to stop Mr. Goyle but none of them were
//__safe__, even using the Hover Charm to slow him down (it was a continuous
//beam and much easier to aim) wouldn’t be safe because he might fall off the
//broomstick, throwing things in his way wouldn’t be safe, and that was getting
//harder and harder to remember as Harry’s blood froze over.

// 6370
//__It’s a game. You’re not trying to __kill__ him. Don’t throw away
//all your future plans for a game…__

// 6371
//Harry could __see__ the pattern, he could __see__ how Mr. Goyle was
//weaving, he could __see__ how and when they all needed to fire in order to
//create a web of shots that Mr. Goyle wouldn’t be able to dodge, but he just
//hadn’t been able to __explain__ it fast enough to his soldiers, they
//couldn’t coordinate their shots well enough, and now they didn’t have enough
//people left to do it -

// 6372
//__I refuse to lose, not like this, not my whole army to one soldier!__

// 6373
//Mr. Goyle’s broomstick turned faster than anything should have been able to
//turn and started to angle in toward Harry and his surviving troops, he could
//sense the boy beside him tensing, getting ready to throw himself in front of
//his general.

// 6374
//__SCREW THIS.__

// 6375
//Harry’s wand came up, focusing on Mr. Goyle, Harry’s mind visualized the
//pattern, and Harry’s lips opened and his voice screamed -

// 6376
//“__Luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____luminos____-”__

// 6377
//____

// 6378
//When Harry’s eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a comfortable
//position with his hands folded over his chest, holding his wand like a fallen
//hero.

// 6379
//Slowly, Harry sat up. His __magic__ was aching, a strange sensation but
//not an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn and lethargy that followed
//hard physical exercise.

// 6380
//“The general’s awake!” cried a voice, and Harry blinked and focused in that
//direction.

// 6381
//Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic hemisphere, and
//Harry realized that the battle wasn’t over. Right… he hadn’t been hit by a
//Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself, so when he woke up, he was still in the
//game.

// 6382
//Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from someone-or-other about not
//exhausting his magic to the point of unconsciousness over a children’s game.
//But he hadn’t hurt Mr. Goyle when he’d lost his temper, and that was the
//important thing.

// 6383
//Then Harry’s mind clicked on another implication, and he looked down at the
//steel ring on his left hand’s pinky finger, and almost swore out loud when he
//saw that the tiny diamond was missing and there was a marshmallow lying on the
//ground near where he’d fallen.

// 6384
//He’d sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and would now need to
//start over.

// 6385
//Could’ve been worse. He could’ve done this fourteen days later, __after
//__Professor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure his father’s rock. That
//was one very good lesson to learn the easy way.

// 6386
//__Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before completely
//exhausting magic.__

// 6387
//Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using up your magic
//didn’t exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees certainly did.

// 6388
//He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained Draco Malfoy, who
//was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield, and smiling coldly at Harry.

// 6389
//“Where’s the fifth soldier?” said Harry.

// 6390
//“Um…” said a boy whose name Harry couldn’t remember at the moment. “I fired a
//Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and hit Lavender, I mean the angle
//shouldn’t have been right but it did…”

// 6391
//Draco was smirking inside the shield.

// 6392
//“So let me guess,” Harry said, looking Draco directly in the eyes, “those neat
//little trios are the formation used by professional magical militaries? Made up
//of trained soldiers who can easily hit moving targets if their own hands are
//steady, and who can combine their defensive powers so long as they stay
//together? Unlike __your__ soldiers?”

// 6393
//The smirk had vanished from Draco’s face, which was now hard and grim.

// 6394
//“You know,” Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others would
//understand the real message passing between them, “it just goes to show that
//you should always question everything you see your role models doing, and ask
//why it’s being done, and whether it makes sense in context for you to do it
//too. Don’t forget to apply that advice to real life, by the way. And thanks for
//the slow-moving clustered targets.”

// 6395
//Because Draco had already gotten that lecture, and, Harry suspected, discounted
//it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to shift his loyalties further away
//from pureblood tradition. Which of course Harry __was.__ But this example
//would make an excellent excuse, next Saturday, to claim that questioning
//authority was a merely practical technique for real life. And Harry would also
//mention the experiments he’d run, first with individuals and then with groups,
//to check that his ideas about the importance of speed had actually been
//__correct,__ by way of hammering home the point of Draco needing to keep
//an eye out at all times for chances to apply the methods in everyday practice.

// 6396
//“You haven’t won __yet,__ General Potter!” snarled Draco. “Maybe we’ll run
//out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a draw.”

// 6397
//A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor Quirrell, in his
//personal judgment, decided one army had won by practical real-world standards.
//There was no __formal__ victory condition, Professor Quirrell had
//explained, because then Harry would figure out how to game the rules. Harry had
//to admit this was a fair cop.

// 6398
//And Harry couldn’t blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an end, because it
//was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army could take out all five
//survivors of the Chaos Legion.

// 6399
//“All right,” Harry said. “Does anyone know anything about General Malfoy’s
//shield spell?”

// 6400
//It developed that Draco’s shield was a version of the standard __Protego__
//which had several disadvantages, the most important of which was that the
//shield couldn’t move with the caster.

// 6401
//The upside - or from Harry’s perspective, downside - was that it was easier to
//learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for long times.

// 6402
//They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order to bring it
//down.

// 6403
//And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of reflection at
//which the spells would bounce off.

// 6404
//The thought occurred to Harry that they could use Wingardium Leviosa to pile up
//heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn’t sustain it against the pressure…
//but then the rocks might fall in afterward and hit Draco, and injuring the
//enemy general for real was not among today’s goals.

// 6405
//“So,” said Harry. “Are there such things as specialized shield-piercing
//spells?”

// 6406
//There were.

// 6407
//Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them.

// 6408
//No one did.

// 6409
//Draco was smirking again, inside his shield.

// 6410
//Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that __wouldn’t__
//bounce.

// 6411
//Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields instead of
//bouncing off them.

// 6412
//…No one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related spell.

// 6413
//Draco sniggered.

// 6414
//Harry sighed.

// 6415
//He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground.

// 6416
//And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that he would just go
//ahead and take down the shield himself, using some method that would remain
//mysterious; and everyone else was to fire on Draco as soon as his shield went
//down.

// 6417
//The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.

// 6418
//Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled.

// 6419
//A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry’s pouch.

// 6420
//Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the blanket over his
//head so no one could see what he did - except Draco, of course.

// 6421
//From Harry’s pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper cables.

// 6422
//…it wasn’t like he’d been about to leave the Muggle world to start a new era of
//magical research, and not take along any way of generating electricity.

// 6423
//Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingers snapping,
//followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket. The shield started
//glowing more brightly, and Harry’s voice said, “Don’t be distracted please,
//eyes on General Malfoy.”

// 6424
//The strain was showing on Draco’s face, along with the fury and annoyance and
//frustration.

// 6425
//Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, __Tell you later.__

// 6426
//And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the forest and smashed
//into Draco’s shield, which shrieked like pieces of sharp glass being rubbed
//together, and Draco staggered.

// 6427
//In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the battery and fed
//them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself into the pouch, and then he
//tore off the blanket and grabbed his wand and stood up.

// 6428
//All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around frantically.

// 6429
//“__Contego,__” Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit, but Harry
//didn’t even know which direction the shield ought to be pointing in. “Did
//anyone see where that came from?” Shaken heads. “And General Malfoy, would you
//mind telling me if __you__ got General Granger?”

// 6430
//“Why yes,” Draco said acidly, “I mind.”

// 6431
//__Oh, hell.__

// 6432
//Harry’s mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco worn out now to
//some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the woods who-knew-where, Harry
//and four other Chaotics left…

// 6433
//“You know, General Granger,” Harry said out loud, “you really should’ve waited
//to attack until after I’d fought General Malfoy. You might’ve been able to get
//__all__ the survivors.”

// 6434
//From somewhere came a girl’s high-pitched laughter.

// 6435
//Harry froze.

// 6436
//__That wasn’t Hermione.__

// 6437
//And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to rise, coming
//from all around them.

// 6438
//“__Don’t be frightened, don’t be sad,__

// 6439
//__We’ll only hurt you if you’re bad…__”

// 6440
//“__Granger cheated!__” burst out Draco inside the shield. “She woke up her
//soldiers! Why doesn’t Professor Quirrell -”

// 6441
//“Let me guess,” Harry said, the sickness already churning in his stomach. He
//really hated losing. “It was a very easy battle, right? They dropped like
//flies?”

// 6442
//“Yes,” Draco said. “We got them all on the first shot -”

// 6443
//The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos Legionnaires.

// 6444
//“No,” Harry said, “we didn’t.”

// 6445
//Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees.

// 6446
//“Allies?” Harry said.

// 6447
//“Allies,” Draco said.

// 6448
//“Good,” said General Granger’s voice, and a spiral of green energy blazed out
//of the woods and shattered Draco’s shield to splinters.

// 6449
//General Granger surveyed the battlefield with a definite feeling of
//satisfaction. She was down to nine Sunshine Soldiers, but that was probably
//enough to handle the last survivor of the enemy forces, especially when Parvati
//and Anthony and Ernie were already holding their wands on General Potter, whom
//she’d ordered taken alive (well, conscious).

// 6450
//It was Bad, she knew, but she’d really really __really__ wanted to gloat.

// 6451
//“There’s a trick, isn’t there?” said Harry, the strain showing in his voice.
//“There __has__ to be some trick. You can’t just turn into a perfect
//general. Not on top of everything else. You’re not that Slytherin! You don’t
//write creepy poetry! __No one’s that good at everything!__”

// 6452
//General Granger glanced around at her Sunshine Soldiers, and then looked back
//at Harry. Everyone was probably watching this on the screens outside.

// 6453
//And General Granger said, “I can do anything if I study hard enough.”

// 6454
//“Oh now that’s just bu-”

// 6455
//“__Somnium.__”

// 6456
//Harry slumped to the ground in mid-sentence.

// 6457
//“SUNSHINE WINS,” intoned the huge voice of Professor Quirrell, seeming to come
//from everywhere and nowhere.

// 6458
//“Niceness has triumphed!” cried General Granger.

// 6459
//“__Hooray!__” shouted the Sunshine Soldiers. Even the Gryffindor boys said
//it, and they said it with pride.

// 6460
//“And what’s the moral of today’s battle?” said General Granger.

// 6461
//“__We can do anything if we study hard enough!__”

// 6462
//And the survivors of the Sunshine Regiment marched off toward the victory
//field, singing their marching song as they went:

// 6463
//__Don’t be frightened, don’t be sad,__

// 6464
//__We’ll only hurt you if you’re bad,__

// 6465
//__And send you to a home that’s true,__

// 6466
//__With new friends to watch over you,__

// 6467
//__Be sure to tell them you were sent__

// 6468
//__By Granger’s Sunshine Regiment!__
