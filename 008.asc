//One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this is going
//to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does not allow me any
//larger font size in which to say **NO**. It honestly hadn’t occurred to me
//that Luna might be a __real__ seer - I’ll have to decide whether to run
//with that or not - but I think we can all safely assume that if Luna
//__is__ a seer, she said something about “light planting a seed in
//darkness”, and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted this in rather the wrong
//way.

//No one had asked for help, that was the problem. They’d just gone around
//talking, eating, or staring into the air while their parents exchanged gossip.
//For whatever odd reason, no one had been sitting down reading a book, which
//meant she couldn’t just sit down next to them and take out her own book. And
//even when she’d boldly taken the initiative by sitting down and continuing her
//third read-through of __Hogwarts: A History,__ no one had seemed inclined
//to sit down next to her.
Але ніхто не просив про допомогу, в цьому і була проблема. Вони лише вештались навкруги,
спілкуючись, смакуючи щось, чи просто дивлячись в нікуди, поки їхні батьки пліткували.
З якоїсь дивної причини, ніхто не сидів і не читав книг, що означало, що вона теж не
могла просто сісти поруч і витягнути свою книгу. І навіть коли вона взяла ініціативу, і
безцеремонно сіла й продовжила втретє читати __Історію Гоґвортсу__, ніхто не проявив
бажання сісти поруч.

// 1055
//Aside from helping people with their homework, or anything else they needed,
//she really didn’t know how to meet people. She didn’t __feel__ like she
//was a shy person. She thought of herself as a take-charge sort of girl. And
//yet, somehow, if there wasn’t some request along the lines of “I can’t remember
//how to do long division” then it was just too __awkward__ to go up to
//someone and say… what? She’d never been able to figure out what. And there
//didn’t seem to be a standard information sheet, which was ridiculous. The whole
//business of meeting people had never seemed sensible to her. Why did
//__she__ have to take all the responsibility herself when there were two
//people involved? Why didn’t adults ever help? She wished some other girl would
//just walk up to __her__ and say, “Hermione, the teacher told me to be
//friends with you.”
Окрім як допомагаючи іншим з їхніми домашніми завданнями, чи з чимось іншим,
вона справді не знала як ще можна знайомитись з людьми. Вона не __почувалась__
сором'язливою. Вона думала про себе як про беру-ініціативу дівчину. Але, чомусь,
якщо не було запиту на зразок "Я забув як ділити в стовпчик", тоді було дуже
__незручно__ підійти до когось і сказати... сказати що? Вона ніколи не могла зрозуміти,
що саме. Взагалі, чому не існувало стандартного набору фраз на різні випадки життя?
Чому саме __вона__ повинна була брати всю відповідальність на себе, якщо в цьому
брали участь дві людини? Чому дорослі ніколи не допомагали? Як же вона хотіла 
щоб інша дівчина просто підійшла до неї і сказала: "Герміоно, вчитель сказав мені
дружити з тобою."

//But let it be quite clear that Hermione Granger, sitting alone on the first day
//of school in one of the few compartments that had been empty, in the last
//carriage of the train, with the compartment door left open just in case anyone
//for any reason wanted to talk to her, was __not__ sad, lonely, gloomy,
//depressed, despairing, or obsessing about her problems. She was, rather,
//rereading __Hogwarts: A History__ for the third time and quite enjoying
//it, with only a faint tinge of annoyance in the back of her mind at the general
//unreasonableness of the world.
Але варто прояснити, Герміона Ґрейнджер, що сиділа сама в перший день школи
в одному з небагатьох порожніх купе останнього вагону потягу, з дверима купе залишеними
відчиненими на випадок, якщо раптом хтось, чомусь, захоче з нею поговорити, __не була__
сумною, самотньою, нахмуреною, в депресії, у відчаї чи одержимою своїми проблемами.
Натомість, вона просто втретє, з задоволенням, перечитувала __Історію Гоґвортсу__.
І лише невиразна тінь ідеї про загальну безглузість світу снувала в закутках свідомості.


// 1057
//There was the sound of an inter-train door opening, and then footsteps and an
//odd slithering sound coming down the hallway of the train. Hermione laid aside
//__Hogwarts: A History__ and stood up and stuck her head outside - just in
//case someone needed help - and saw a young boy in a wizard’s dress robes,
//probably first or second year going by his height, and looking quite silly with
//a scarf wrapped around his head. A small trunk stood on the floor next to him.
//Even as she saw him, he knocked on the door of another, closed compartment, and
//he said in a voice only slightly muffled by the scarf, “Excuse me, can I ask a
//quick question?”
Пролунав звук відкривання міжвагонних дверей, після чого в коридорі почулись кроки
і звук ковзання чогось об підлогу. Герміона відклала __Історію Гоґвортсу__, піднялась
і виглянула в коридор, на випадок якщо комусь потрібна допомога. В коридорі вона побачила
молодого хлопця в мантії, судячи по зросту першо- чи другокурсника. З шарфом, обмотаним
навкруги голови він виглядав дурнувато. На підлозі біля нього стояла невелика валіза.
Навіть коли вони подивилась на нього, він постукав у двері іншого, зачиненого купе.
-- Вибачте, можна задати маленьке питання? -- спитав він голосом, лише трішки заглушеним
шарфом.

// 1058
//She didn’t hear the answer from inside the compartment, but after the boy
//opened the door, she did think she heard him say - unless she’d somehow
//misheard - “Does anyone here know the six quarks or where I can find a
//first-year girl named Hermione Granger?”
Вона не почула, що відповіли з купе, але після того як він відчинив двері, їй здалось,
що вона почула, якщо їй звісно не причулось, що він запитав: "Чи знає хтось з присутніх
шість ароматів кварків, чи де я можу знайти першкурсницю Герміону Ґрейнджер?"

// 1059
//After the boy had closed that compartment door, Hermione said, “Can I help you
//with something?”
Після того як хлопець зачинив двері купе, Герміона сказала:
-- Чи можу я чимось допомогти?

// 1060
//The scarfed face turned to look at her, and the voice said, “Not unless you can
//name the six quarks or tell me where to find Hermione Granger.”
Лице зі шарфом повернулось і подивилось на неї, після чого голос сказав:
-- Ні, хіба що ти знаєш шість ароматів кварків або можеш сказати мені де я можу
знайти Герміону Ґрейнджер.

// 1061
//“Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, and why are you looking for her?”
-- Верхній, нижній, дивний, чарівний, правдивий, гарний, а чому ти шукаєш її?

// 1062
//It was hard to tell from this distance, but she thought she saw the boy grin
//widely under his scarf. “Ah, so __you’re__ a first-year girl named
//Hermione Granger,” said that young, muffled voice. “On the train to Hogwarts,
//no less.” The boy started to walk towards her and her compartment, and his
//trunk slithered along after him. “Technically, all I needed to do was
//__look__ for you, but it seems likely that I’m meant to talk to you or
//invite you to join my party or get a key magical item from you or find out that
//Hogwarts was built over the ruins of an ancient temple or something. PC or NPC,
//that is the question?”
Важко було сказати з такої відстані, але їй здалось, що вона побачила як він широко
усміхнувся під шарфом.
-- Аа, то це __ти__ першокурсниця Герміона Ґрейнджер. -- сказав хлопчачий,
заглушений шарфом голос. -- Ще й на потязі в Гоґвортс. -- хлопець почав йти в
напрямку її купе, його валіза поковзала за ним. -- Формально, все, що я мав зробити,
це __знайти__ тебе, але, ймовірно, я повинен поспілкуватись з тобою, чи запросити
тебе в свою групу, чи отримати від тебе магічний ключ, чи дізнатись, що Гоґвортс
був збудований на руїнах стародавнього храму чи щось в такому роді. Бот чи гравець -
ось питання?

// 1063
//Hermione opened her mouth to reply to this, but then she couldn’t think of any
//__possible__ reply to… __whatever__ it was she’d just heard, even as
//the boy walked over to her, looked inside the compartment, nodded with
//satisfaction, and sat down on the bench across from her own. His trunk scurried
//in after him, grew to three times its former diameter and snuggled up next to
//her own in an oddly disturbing fashion.
Герміона було відкрила рот аби відповісти на це, але тоді не придумала жодної __можливої__
відповіді на... __чим би це не було__ те, що вона щойно почула, поки хлопець підійшов до неї,
оглянув купе, задоволено кивнув, і сів на лавці навпроти. Його валіза заповзла
в купе за ним, виросла до втричі більшого розміру і влаштувалась, у незрозуміло
хвилюючій позі, поруч з її валізою.


// 1064
//“Please, have a seat,” said the boy, “and do please close the door behind you,
//if you would. Don’t worry, I don’t bite anyone who doesn’t bite me first.” He
//was already unwinding the scarf from around his head.
-- Будь ласка, сідай. -- сказав хлопець. -- І закрий будь ласка за собою двері.
Не хвилюйся, я не кусаю нікого хто не вкусив мене першим. -- він вже почав
розмотувати шарф навкруги його голови.

// 1065
//The imputation that this boy thought she was __scared__ of him made her
//hand send the door sliding shut, jamming it into the wall with unnecessary
//force. She spun around and saw a young face with bright, laughing green eyes,
//and an angry red-dark scar set into his forehead that reminded her of something
//in the back of her mind but right now she had more important things to think
//about. “I didn’t say I was Hermione Granger!”

// 1066
//“__I __didn’t say you __said__ you were Hermione Granger, I just said
//you were Hermione Granger. If you’re asking how I know, it’s because I know
//everything. Good evening ladies and gentlemen, my name is Harry James
//Potter-Evans-Verres or Harry Potter for short, I know that probably doesn’t
//mean anything to __you__ for a change -”

// 1067
//Hermione’s mind finally made the connection. The scar on his forehead, the
//shape of a lightning bolt. “Harry Potter! You’re in __Modern Magical
//History__ and __The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts__ and __Great
//Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.__” It was actually the very first
//time in her whole life that she’d __met__ someone from inside a
//__book,__ and it was a rather odd feeling.

// 1068
//The boy blinked three times. “I’m in __books__? Wait, of course I’m in
//books… what a strange thought.”

// 1069
//“Goodness, didn’t you know?” said Hermione. “I’d have found out everything I
//could if it was me.”

// 1070
//The boy spoke rather dryly. “Miss Granger, it has been less than 72 hours since
//I went to Diagon Alley and discovered my claim to fame. I have spent the last
//two days buying science books. __Believe me,__ I intend to find out
//everything I can.” The boy hesitated. “What __do__ the books say about
//me?”

// 1071
//Hermione Granger’s mind flashed back, she hadn’t realised she would be tested
//on __those__ books so she’d read them only once, but it was just a month
//ago so the material was still fresh in her mind. “You’re the only one who’s
//survived the Killing Curse so you’re called the Boy-Who-Lived. You were born to
//James Potter and Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans on the 31st of July 1980. On
//the 31st of October 1981 the Dark Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named though I don’t
//know why not attacked your home. You were found alive with the scar on your
//forehead in the ruins of your parents’ house near the burnt remains of
//You-Know-Who’s body. Chief Warlock Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent
//you off somewhere, no one knows where. __The Rise and Fall of the Dark
//Arts__ claims that you survived because of your mother’s love and that your scar
//contains all of the Dark Lord’s magical power and that the centaurs fear you,
//but __Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century__ doesn’t mention
//anything like that and __Modern Magical History__ warns that there are
//lots of crackpot theories about you.”

// 1072
//The boy’s mouth was hanging open. “Were you told to wait for Harry Potter on
//the train to Hogwarts, or something like that?”

// 1073
//“No,” Hermione said. “Who told you about __me?__”

// 1074
//“Professor McGonagall and I believe I see why. Do you have an eidetic memory,
//Hermione?”

// 1075
//Hermione shook her head. “It’s not photographic, I’ve always wished it was but
//I had to read my school books five times over to memorize them all.”

// 1076
//“Really,” the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. “I hope you don’t mind if
//I test that - it’s not that I don’t believe you, but as the saying goes,
//‘Trust, but verify’. No point in wondering when I can just do the experiment.”

// 1077
//Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She so loved tests. “Go ahead.”

// 1078
//The boy stuck a hand into a pouch at his side and said “Magical Drafts and
//Potions by Arsenius Jigger”. When he withdrew his hand it was holding the book
//he’d named.

// 1079
//Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she’d ever wanted
//anything.

// 1080
//The boy opened the book to somewhere in the middle and looked down. “If you
//were making __oil of sharpness__ -”

// 1081
//“I can __see__ that page from here, you know!”

// 1082
//The boy tilted the book so that she couldn’t see it any more, and flipped the
//pages again. “If you were brewing a __potion of spider climbing,__ what
//would be the next ingredient you added after the Acromantula silk?”

// 1083
//“After dropping in the silk, wait until the potion has turned exactly the shade
//of the cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees from the horizon and 8 minutes before the
//tip of the sun first becomes visible. Stir eight times widdershins and once
//deasil, and then add eight drams of unicorn bogies.”

// 1084
//The boy shut the book with a sharp snap and put the book back into his pouch,
//which swallowed it with a small burping noise. “Well well well __well__
//well well. I should like to make you a proposition, Miss Granger.”

// 1085
//“A proposition?” Hermione said suspiciously. Girls weren’t supposed to listen
//to those.

// 1086
//It was also at this point that Hermione realised the other thing - well, one of
//the things - which was odd about the boy. Apparently people who were
//__in__ books actually __sounded__ like a book when they talked. This
//was quite the surprising discovery.

// 1087
//The boy reached into his pouch and said, “can of pop”, retrieving a bright
//green cylinder. He held it out to her and said, “Can I offer you something to
//drink?”

// 1088
//Hermione politely accepted the fizzy drink. In fact she __was__ feeling
//sort of thirsty by now. “Thank you very much,” Hermione said as she popped the
//top. “Was that your proposition?”

// 1089
//The boy coughed. “No,” he said. Just as Hermione started to drink, he said,
//“I’d like you to help me take over the universe.”

// 1090
//Hermione finished her drink and lowered the can. “No thank you, I’m not evil.”

// 1091
//The boy looked at her in surprise, as though he’d been expecting some other
//answer. “Well, I was speaking a bit rhetorically,” he said. “In the sense of
//the Baconian project, you know, not political power. ‘The effecting of all
//things possible’ and so on. I want to conduct experimental studies of spells,
//figure out the underlying laws, bring magic into the domain of science, merge
//the wizarding and Muggle worlds, raise the entire planet’s standard of living,
//move humanity centuries ahead, discover the secret of immortality, colonize the
//Solar System, explore the galaxy, and most importantly, figure out what the
//heck is really going on here because all of this is blatantly impossible.”

// 1092
//That sounded a bit more interesting. “And?”

// 1093
//The boy stared at her incredulously. “__And?__ That’s not
//__enough?__”

// 1094
//“And what do you want from me?” said Hermione.

// 1095
//“I want you to help me do the research, of course. With your encyclopedic
//memory added to my intelligence and rationality, we’ll have the Baconian
//project finished in no time, where by ‘no time’ I mean probably at least
//thirty-five years.”

// 1096
//Hermione was beginning to find this boy annoying. “I haven’t seen you do
//anything intelligent. Maybe I’ll let __you__ help me with __my__
//research.”

// 1097
//There was a certain silence in the compartment.

// 1098
//“So you’re asking me to demonstrate my intelligence, then,” said the boy after
//a long pause.

// 1099
//Hermione nodded.

// 1100
//“I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous project, and tends to
//make your life a lot more surreal.”

// 1101
//“I’m not impressed yet,” Hermione said. Unnoticed, the green drink once again
//rose to her lips.

// 1102
//“Well, maybe __this__ will impress you,” the boy said. He leaned forward
//and looked at her intensely. “I’ve already done a bit of experimenting and I
//found out that I don’t need the wand, I can make anything I want happen just by
//snapping my fingers.”

// 1103
//It came just as Hermione was in the middle of swallowing, and she choked and
//coughed and expelled the bright green fluid.

// 1104
//Onto her brand new, never-worn witch’s robes, on the very first day of school.

// 1105
//Hermione actually screamed. It was a high-pitched sound that sounded like an
//air raid siren in the closed compartment. “__Eek! My clothes!__”

// 1106
//“Don’t panic!” said the boy. “I can fix it for you. Just watch!” He raised a
//hand and snapped his fingers.

// 1107
//“You’ll -” Then she looked down at herself.

// 1108
//The green fluid was still there, but even as she watched, it started to vanish
//and fade and within just a few moments, it was like she’d never spilled
//anything at herself.

// 1109
//Hermione stared at the boy, who was wearing a rather smug sort of smile.

// 1110
//Wordless wandless magic! At __his__ age? When he’d only gotten the
//schoolbooks __three days__ ago?

// 1111
//Then she remembered what she’d read, and she gasped and flinched back from him.
//__All the Dark Lord’s magical power! In his scar!__

// 1112
//She rose hastily to her feet. “I, I, I need to go the toilet, wait here all
//right -” she had to find a grownup she had to tell them -

// 1113
//The boy’s smile faded. “It was just a trick, Hermione. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean
//to scare you.”

// 1114
//Her hand halted on the door handle. “A __trick?__”

// 1115
//“Yes,” said the boy. “You asked me to demonstrate my intelligence. So I did
//something apparently impossible, which is always a good way to show off. I
//can’t __really__ do anything just by snapping my fingers.” The boy paused.
//“At least I don’t __think__ I can, I’ve never actually tested it
//experimentally.” The boy raised his hand and snapped his fingers again. “Nope,
//no banana.”

// 1116
//Hermione was as confused as she’d ever been in her life.

// 1117
//The boy was now smiling again at the look on her face. “I did __warn__ you
//that challenging my ingenuity tends to make your life surreal. Do remember this
//the next time I warn you about something.”

// 1118
//“But, but,” Hermione stammered. “What did you __do,__ then?”

// 1119
//The boy’s gaze took on a measuring, weighing quality that she’d never seen
//before from someone her own age. “You think you have what it takes to be a
//scientist in your own right, with or without my help? Then let’s see how
//__you__ investigate a confusing phenomenon.”

// 1120
//“I…” Hermione’s mind went blank for a moment. She loved tests but she’d never
//had a test like __this__ before. Frantically, she tried to cast back for
//anything she’d read about what scientists were supposed to do. Her mind skipped
//gears, ground against itself, and spat back the instructions for doing a
//science investigation project:

// 1121
//__Step 1: Form a hypothesis.__

// 1122
//__Step 2: Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.__

// 1123
//__Step 3: Measure the results.______

// 1124
//__Step 4: Make a cardboard poster.__

// 1125
//Step 1 was to form a hypothesis. That meant, try to think of something that
//__could__ have happened just now. “All right. My hypothesis is that you
//cast a Charm on my robes to make anything spilled on it vanish.”

// 1126
//“All right,” said the boy, “is that your answer?”

// 1127
//The shock was wearing off, and Hermione’s mind was starting to work properly.
//“Wait, that can’t be right. I didn’t see you touch your wand or say any spells
//so how could you have cast a Charm?”

// 1128
//The boy waited, his face neutral.

// 1129
//“But suppose all the robes come from the store with a Charm __already__ on
//them to keep them clean, which would be a useful sort of Charm for them to
//have. You found that out by spilling something on __yourself__ earlier.”

// 1130
//Now the boy’s eyebrows lifted. “Is __that__ your answer?”

// 1131
//“No, I haven’t done Step 2, ‘Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.’”

// 1132
//The boy closed his mouth again, and began to smile.

// 1133
//Hermione looked at the drinks can, which she’d automatically put into the
//cupholder at the window. She took it up and peered inside, and found that it
//was around one-third full.

// 1134
//“Well,” said Hermione, “the experiment I want to do is to pour it on my robes
//and see what happens, and my prediction is that the stain will disappear. Only
//if it __doesn’t__ work, my robes will be stained, and I don’t want that.”

// 1135
//“Do it to mine,” said the boy, “that way you don’t have to worry about your
//robes getting stained.”

// 1136
//“But -” Hermione said. There was something __wrong__ with that thinking
//but she didn’t know how to say it exactly.

// 1137
//“I have spare robes in my trunk,” said the boy.

// 1138
//“But there’s nowhere for you to change,” Hermione objected. Then she thought
//better of it. “Though I suppose I could leave and close the door -”

// 1139
//“I have somewhere to change in my trunk, too.”

// 1140
//Hermione looked at his trunk, which, she was beginning to suspect, was rather
//more special than her own.

// 1141
//“All right,” Hermione said, “since you say so,” and she rather gingerly poured
//a bit of green pop onto a corner of the boy’s robes. Then she stared at it,
//trying to remember how long the original fluid had taken to disappear…

// 1142
//And the green stain vanished!

// 1143
//Hermione let out a sigh of relief, not least because this meant she wasn’t
//dealing with all of the Dark Lord’s magical power.

// 1144
//Well, Step 3 was measuring the results, but in this case that was just seeing
//that the stain had vanished. And she supposed she could probably skip Step 4,
//about the cardboard poster. “My answer is that the robes are Charmed to keep
//themselves clean.”

// 1145
//“Not quite,” said the boy.

// 1146
//Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she __wouldn’t__
//have felt that way, the boy wasn’t a teacher, but it was still a test and she’d
//gotten a question wrong and that always felt like a little punch in the
//stomach.

// 1147
//(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione Granger that she
//had never let that stop her, or even let it interfere with her love of being
//tested.)

// 1148
//“The sad thing is,” said the boy, “you probably did everything the book told
//you to do. You made a prediction that would distinguish between the robe being
//charmed and not charmed, and you tested it, and rejected the null hypothesis
//that the robe was not charmed. But unless you read the very, very best sort of
//books, they won’t quite teach you how to do science __properly__. Well
//enough to __really__ get the right answer, I mean, and not just churn out
//another publication like Dad always complains about. So let me try to explain -
//without giving away the answer - what you did wrong this time, and I’ll give
//you another chance.”

// 1149
//She was starting to resent the boy’s oh-so-superior tone when he was just
//another eleven-year-old like her, but that was secondary to finding out what
//she’d done wrong. “All right.”

// 1150
//The boy’s expression grew more intense. “This is a game based on a famous
//experiment called the 2-4-6 task, and this is how it works. I have a
//__rule__ - known to me, but not to you - which fits some triplets of three
//numbers, but not others. 2-4-6 is one example of a triplet which fits the rule.
//In fact… let me write down the rule, just so you know it’s a fixed rule, and
//fold it up and give it to you. Please don’t look, since I infer from earlier
//that you can read upside-down.”

// 1151
//The boy said “paper” and “mechanical pencil” to his pouch, and she shut her
//eyes tightly while he wrote.

// 1152
//“There,” said the boy, and he was holding a tightly folded piece of paper. “Put
//this in your pocket,” and she did.

// 1153
//“Now the way this game works,” said the boy, “is that you give me a triplet of
//three numbers, and I’ll tell you ‘Yes’ if the three numbers are an instance of
//the rule, and ‘No’ if they’re not. I am Nature, the rule is one of my laws, and
//you are investigating me. You already know that 2-4-6 gets a ‘Yes’. When you’ve
//performed all the further experimental tests you want - asked me as many
//triplets as you feel necessary - you stop and guess the rule, and then you can
//unfold the sheet of paper and see how you did. Do you understand the game?”

// 1154
//“Of course I do,” said Hermione.

// 1155
//“Go.”

// 1156
//“4-6-8” said Hermione.

// 1157
//“Yes,” said the boy.

// 1158
//“10-12-14”, said Hermione.

// 1159
//“Yes,” said the boy.

// 1160
//Hermione tried to cast her mind a little further afield, since it seemed like
//she’d already done all the testing she needed, and yet it couldn’t be that
//easy, could it?

// 1161
//“1-3-5.”

// 1162
//“Yes.”

// 1163
//“Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1.”

// 1164
//“Yes.”

// 1165
//Hermione couldn’t think of anything else to do. “The rule is that the numbers
//have to increase by two each time.”

// 1166
//“Now suppose I tell you,” said the boy, “that this test is harder than it
//looks, and that only 20// of grownups get it right.”

// 1167
//Hermione frowned. What had she missed? Then, suddenly, she thought of a test
//she still needed to do.

// 1168
//“2-5-8!” she said triumphantly.

// 1169
//“Yes.”

// 1170
//“10-20-30!”

// 1171
//“Yes.”

// 1172
//“The real answer is that the numbers have to go up by the __same__ amount
//each time. It doesn’t have to be 2.”

// 1173
//“Very well,” said the boy, “take the paper out and see how you did.”

// 1174
//Hermione took the paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.

// 1175
//__Three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to highest.__

// 1176
//Hermione’s jaw dropped. She had the distinct feeling of something terribly
//unfair having been done to her, that the boy was a dirty rotten cheating liar,
//but when she cast her mind back she couldn’t think of any wrong responses that
//he’d given.

// 1177
//“What you’ve just discovered is called ‘positive bias’,” said the boy. “You had
//a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets that should make the
//rule say ‘Yes’. But you didn’t try to test any triplets that should make the
//rule say ‘No’. In fact you didn’t get a __single__ ‘No’, so ‘any three
//numbers’ could have just as easily been the rule. It’s sort of like how people
//imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying to
//imagine experiments that could falsify them - that’s not quite exactly the same
//mistake but it’s close. You have to learn to look on the negative side of
//things, stare into the darkness. When this experiment is performed, only 20// of
//grownups get the answer right. And many of the others invent fantastically
//complicated hypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since
//they’ve done so many experiments and everything came out like they expected.”

// 1178
//“Now,” said the boy, “do you want to take another shot at the original
//problem?”

// 1179
//His eyes were quite intent now, as though this were the __real__ test.

// 1180
//Hermione shut her eyes and tried to concentrate. She was sweating underneath
//her robes. She had an odd feeling that this was the hardest she’d ever been
//asked to think on a test or maybe even the __first__ time she’d ever been
//asked to think on a test.

// 1181
//What other experiment could she do? She had a Chocolate Frog, could she try to
//rub some of that on the robes and see if __it__ vanished? But that still
//didn’t seem like the kind of twisty negative thinking the boy was asking for.
//Like she was still asking for a ‘Yes’ if the Chocolate Frog stain disappeared,
//rather than asking for a ‘No’.

// 1182
//So… on her hypothesis… when should the pop… __not__ vanish?

// 1183
//“I have an experiment to do,” Hermione said. “I want to pour some pop on the
//floor, and see if it __doesn’t__ vanish. Do you have some paper towels in
//your pouch, so I can mop up the spill if this doesn’t work?”

// 1184
//“I have napkins,” said the boy. His face still looked neutral.

// 1185
//Hermione took the can, and poured a small bit of pop onto the floor.

// 1186
//A few seconds later, it vanished.

// 1187
//Then the realisation hit her and she felt like kicking herself. “Of course!
//__You__ gave me that can! It’s not the robe that’s enchanted, it was the
//pop all along!”

// 1188
//The boy stood up and bowed to her solemnly. He was grinning widely now. “Then…
//may I help you with your research, Hermione Granger?”

// 1189
//“I, ah…” Hermione was still feeling the rush of euphoria, but she wasn’t quite
//sure about how to answer __that.__

// 1190
//They were interrupted by a weak, tentative, faint, rather __reluctant__
//knocking at the door.

// 1191
//The boy turned and looked out the window, and said, “I’m not wearing my scarf,
//so can you get that?”

// 1192
//It was at this point that Hermione realised why the boy - no, the
//Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter - had been wearing the scarf over his head in the
//first place, and felt a little silly for not realising it earlier. It was
//actually sort of odd, since she would have thought Harry Potter would proudly
//display himself to the world; and the thought occurred to her that he might
//actually be shyer than he seemed.

// 1193
//When Hermione pulled the door open, she was greeted by a trembling young boy
//who looked exactly like he knocked.

// 1194
//“Excuse me,” said the boy in a tiny voice, “I’m Neville Longbottom. I’m looking
//for my pet toad, I, I can’t seem to find it anywhere on this carriage… have you
//seen my toad?”

// 1195
//“No,” Hermione said, and then her helpfulness kicked in full throttle. “Have
//you checked all the other compartments?”

// 1196
//“Yes,” whispered the boy.

// 1197
//“Then we’ll just have to check all the other carriages,” Hermione said briskly.
//“I’ll help you. My name is Hermione Granger, by the way.”

// 1198
//The boy looked like he might faint with gratitude.

// 1199
//“Hold on,” came the voice of the __other__ boy - Harry Potter. “I’m not
//sure that’s the best way to do it.”

// 1200
//At this Neville looked like he might cry, and Hermione swung around, angered.
//If Harry Potter was the sort of person who’d abandon a little boy just because
//he didn’t want to be interrupted… “What? Why __not?__”

// 1201
//“Well,” said Harry Potter, “It’s going to take a while to check the whole train
//by hand, and we might miss the toad anyway, and if we didn’t find it by the
//time we’re at Hogwarts, he’d be in trouble. So what would make a lot more sense
//is if he went directly to the front carriage, where the prefects are, and asked
//a prefect for help. That was the first thing I did when I was looking for you,
//Hermione, although they didn’t actually know. But they might have spells or
//magic items that would make it a lot easier to find a toad. We’re only
//first-years.”

// 1202
//That… __did__ make a lot of sense.

// 1203
//“Do you think you can make it to the prefects’ carriage on your own?” asked
//Harry Potter. “I’ve sort of got reasons for not wanting to show my face too
//much.”

// 1204
//Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. “I remember that voice! You’re
//one of the Lords of Chaos! __You’re the one who gave me chocolate!__”

// 1205
//What? What what __what?__

// 1206
//Harry Potter turned his head from the window and rose dramatically. “I
//__never!__” he said, voice full of indignation. “Do I look like the sort
//of villain who would give sweets to a child?”

// 1207
//Neville’s eyes widened. “__You’re__ Harry Potter? __The__ Harry
//Potter? __You?__”

// 1208
//“No, just __a__ Harry Potter, there are three of me on this train -”

// 1209
//Neville gave a small shriek and ran away. There was a brief pattering of
//frantic footsteps and then the sound of a carriage door opening and closing.

// 1210
//Hermione sat down hard on her bench. Harry Potter closed the door and then sat
//down next to her.

// 1211
//“Can you please explain to me what’s going on?” Hermione said in a weak voice.
//She wondered if hanging around Harry Potter meant always being this confused.

// 1212
//“Oh, well, what happened was that Fred and George and I saw this poor small boy
//at the train station - the woman next to him had gone away for a bit, and he
//was looking really frightened, like he was sure he was about to be attacked by
//Death Eaters or something. Now, there’s a saying that the fear is often worse
//than the thing itself, so it occurred to me that this was a lad who could
//actually benefit from seeing his worst nightmare come true and that it wasn’t
//so bad as he feared -”

// 1213
//Hermione sat there with her mouth wide open.

// 1214
//“- and Fred and George came up with this spell to make the scarves over our
//faces darken and blur, like we were undead kings and those were our grave
//shrouds -”

// 1215
//She didn’t like at all where this was going.

// 1216
//“- and after we were done giving him all the sweets I’d bought, we were like,
//‘Let’s give him some money! Ha ha ha! Have some Knuts, boy! Have a silver
//Sickle!’ and dancing around him and laughing evilly and so on. I think there
//were some people in the crowd who wanted to interfere at first, but bystander
//apathy held them off at least until they saw what we were doing, and then I
//think they were all too confused to do anything. Finally he said in this tiny
//little whisper ‘go away’ so the three of us all screamed and ran off, shrieking
//something about the light burning us. Hopefully he won’t be as scared of being
//bullied in the future. That’s called desensitisation therapy, by the way.”

// 1217
//Okay, she __hadn’t__ guessed right about where this was going.

// 1218
//The burning fire of indignation that was one of Hermione’s primary engines
//sputtered into life, even though part of her __did__ sort of see what
//they’d been trying to do. “That’s awful! __You’re__ awful! That poor boy!
//What you did was __mean!__”

// 1219
//“I think the word you’re looking for is __enjoyable,__ and in any case
//you’re asking the wrong question. The question is, did it do more good than
//harm, or more harm than good? If you have any arguments to contribute to
//__that__ question I’m glad to hear them, but I won’t entertain any other
//criticisms until that one is settled. I certainly agree that what I did
//__looks__ all terrible and bullying and mean, since it involves a scared
//little boy and so on, but that’s hardly the key issue now is it? That’s called
//__consequentialism,__ by the way, it means that whether an act is right or
//wrong isn’t determined by whether it __looks__ bad, or mean, or anything
//like that, the only question is how it will turn out in the end - what are the
//consequences.”

// 1220
//Hermione opened her mouth to say something utterly __searing __but
//unfortunately she seemed to have neglected the part where she thought of
//something to say before opening her mouth. All she could come up with was,
//“What if he has __nightmares?__”

// 1221
//“Honestly, I don’t think he needed our help to have nightmares, and if he has
//nightmares about __this__ instead, then it’ll be nightmares involving
//horrible monsters who give you chocolate and that was sort of the whole
//__point__.”

// 1222
//Hermione’s brain kept hiccoughing in confusion every time she tried to get
//properly angry. “Is your life always this peculiar?” she said at last.

// 1223
//Harry Potter’s face gleamed with pride. “I __make__ it that peculiar.
//You’re looking at the product of a lot of hard work and elbow grease.”

// 1224
//“So…” Hermione said, and trailed off awkwardly.

// 1225
//“So,” Harry Potter said, “how much science do you know exactly? I can do
//calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and decision theory and a
//lot of cognitive science, and I’ve read __The Feynman Lectures__ (or
//volume 1 anyway) and __Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases__
//and __Language in Thought and Action__ and __Influence: Science and
//Practice__ and __Rational Choice in an Uncertain World__ and __Godel,
//Escher, Bach__ and __A Step Farther Out__ and -”

// 1226
//The ensuing quiz and counter-quiz went on for several minutes before being
//interrupted by another timid knock at the door. “Come in,” she and Harry Potter
//said at almost the same time, and it slid back to reveal Neville Longbottom.

// 1227
//Neville __was__ actually crying now. “I went to the front carriage and
//found a p-prefect but he t-told me that prefects weren’t to be bothered over
//little things like m-missing toads.”

// 1228
//The Boy-Who-Lived’s face changed. His lips set in a thin line. His voice, when
//he spoke, was cold and grim. “What were his colours? Green and silver?”

// 1229
//“N-no, his badge was r-red and gold.”

// 1230
//“__Red and gold!__” burst out Hermione. “But those are
//__Gryffindor’s__ colours!”

// 1231
//Harry Potter __hissed__ at that, a frightening sort of sound that could
//have come from a live snake and made both her and Neville flinch. “I
//__suppose,”__ Harry Potter spat, “that finding some first-year’s toad
//isn’t __heroic__ enough to be worthy of a __Gryffindor__ prefect.
//Come on, Neville, __I’ll__ come with you this time, we’ll see if the
//Boy-Who-Lived gets more attention. First we’ll find a prefect who ought to know
//a spell, and if that doesn’t work, we’ll find a prefect who isn’t afraid of
//getting their hands dirty, and if __that __doesn’t work, I’ll start
//recruiting my fans and if we have to we’ll take apart the whole train screw by
//screw.”

// 1232
//The Boy-Who-Lived stood up and grabbed Neville’s hand in his, and Hermione
//realised with a sudden brain hiccough that they were nearly the same size, even
//though some part of her had insisted that Harry Potter was a foot taller than
//that, and Neville at least six inches shorter.

// 1233
//“__Stay!__” Harry Potter snapped at her - no, wait, at his __trunk__
//- and he closed the door behind him firmly as he left.

// 1234
//She probably should have gone with them, but in just a brief moment Harry
//Potter had turned so scary that she was actually rather glad she hadn’t thought
//to suggest it.

// 1235
//Hermione’s mind was now so jumbled that she didn’t even think she could
//properly read “History: A Hogwarts”. She felt as if she’d just been run over by
//a steamroller and turned into a pancake. She wasn’t sure what she was thinking
//or what she was feeling or why. She just sat by the window and stared at the
//moving scenery.

// 1236
//Well, she did at least know why she was feeling a little sad inside.

// 1237
//Maybe Gryffindor wasn’t as wonderful as she had thought.
