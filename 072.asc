//== SA, Plausible Deniability, Pt 7

// 12489
//The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it was amid the
//peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the enchanted ceiling of the Great
//Hall that Hermione left for the Ravenclaw Tower alongside her study partner
//Harry Potter, who lately seemed to have a __ridiculous__ amount of time
//for studying. She hadn’t the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his actual
//homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house elves while he slept.

// 12490
//Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them as they passed
//through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which were more like siege gates
//of a castle than anything students ought to go through on the way back from
//supper.

// 12491
//They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant babble of student
//conversation had faded into silence; and then the two of them went on a little
//further through the stone corridors before Hermione finally spoke.

// 12492
//“Why’d you do that, Harry?”

// 12493
//“Do what?” said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if his mind were
//quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important things.

// 12494
//“I mean, why didn’t you just __tell __them no?”

// 12495
//“Well,” Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, “I can’t just go
//around saying ‘no’ every time someone asks me about something I haven’t done. I
//mean, suppose someone asks me, ‘Harry, did you pull the prank with the
//invisible paint?’ and I say ‘No’ and then they say ‘Harry, do you know who
//messed with the Gryffindor Seeker’s broomstick?’ and I say ‘I refuse to answer
//that question.’ It’s sort of a giveaway.”

// 12496
//“And __that’s __why,” Hermione said carefully, “you told everyone…” She
//concentrated, rembering the exact words. “That if hypothetically there
//__was __a conspiracy, you could not confirm or deny that the true master
//of the conspiracy was Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, and in fact you wouldn’t even
//be able to admit the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you
//questions about it.”

// 12497
//“Yep,” said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. “That’ll teach them to take
//hypothetical scenarios too seriously.”

// 12498
//“And you told __me __not to answer anything -”

// 12499
//“They might not __believe __you, if you deny it,” said Harry. “So it’s
//better to say nothing, unless you want them to think you’re a liar.”

// 12500
//“But -” Hermione said helplessly. “But - but now people think I’m __doing
//__things for __Salazar Slytherin!__” The way the Gryffindors had been
//looking at her - the way the __Slytherins __had been looking at her -

// 12501
//“It goes along with being a hero,” Harry said. “Have you seen what the
//__Quibbler __says about __me?__”

// 12502
//For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a newspaper article
//about her, and instead of the story being about her winning a nationwide
//spelling bee or any of the other ways she’d imagined getting into the papers,
//the headline said “HERMIONE GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT”.

// 12503
//It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine business.

// 12504
//Harry’s voice turned a bit more formal. “Speaking of which, Miss Granger, how
//goes your latest quest?”

// 12505
//“Well,” said Hermione, “unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin really
//__does __show up and tell us where to find bullies, I don’t think we’re
//going to have much luck.” Not that she was sorry about that.

// 12506
//She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a peculiarly intense
//look.

// 12507
//“You know, Hermione,” the boy said quietly, as though to make sure that nobody
//else in the world heard, “I think you’re right. I think some people get a lot
//more help than others in becoming heroes. And __I __don’t think that’s
//fair, either.”

// 12508
//And Harry grabbed at her witch’s robes where they lay over her arm, and hustled
//her into a side-hall of the corridor they were walking through, her mouth
//gaping open in surprise even as Harry’s wand came into his hand, they rounded a
//curve of the side-hall and it was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and
//Harry into each other, even as Harry pointed to the way they’d come and softly
//said “__Quietus__”, then a moment later, in the other direction,
//”__Quietus__” again.

// 12509
//The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side, but even upward
//toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.

// 12510
//And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, “Invisibility cloak.”

// 12511
//“__Gleep?__” said Hermione.

// 12512
//Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric from the
//mokeskin device. “Don’t worry,” the boy said with a small grin, “they’re so
//rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule against them…”

// 12513
//And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said, his voice
//strangely formal, “I do not give you, but loan you, my cloak, unto Hermione
//Jean Granger. Protect her well.”

// 12514
//She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that swallowed all the
//light that fell on it except what glinted from small strange reflections,
//fabric so perfectly black it should’ve shown dust or lint or __something
//__but it didn’t, the longer you looked the more you felt like what you were
//seeing wasn’t really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a
//black cloak.

// 12515
//“Take it, Hermione.”

// 12516
//Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp the fabric; and
//then just as her brain woke up and she started to pull her hand back, Harry let
//go of the cloak and it started to fall and she grabbed at it without thinking.
//And the instant her fingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible
//jolt run through her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was
//like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of her mind.

// 12517
//“That’s one of my quest items, Hermione,” Harry said softly. “It belonged to my
//father, and it’s not something I can replace, if it’s lost. Don’t loan it to
//anyone else, don’t show it to anyone, don’t tell anyone it exists… but if you
//want to borrow it for a while, just come to me and ask.”

// 12518
//Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black folds and stared
//back up at Harry.

// 12519
//“I can’t -”

// 12520
//“You certainly can,” Harry said. “Because there’s nothing even the tiniest bit
//fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box next to my bed one morning,
//and you… not.” Harry paused thoughtfully. “Unless you __did __get your own
//invisibility cloak, in which case never mind.”

// 12521
//Then the implications of __invisibility cloak __finally dawned on her, and
//she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though they were close enough together
//that she couldn’t quite straighten her arm properly, and her voice rose with
//considerable indignation as she said, “So __that’s __how you disappeared
//from the Potions closet! And the time when -” and then she trailed off, because
//even __with __an invisibility cloak she still couldn’t see how Harry had…

// 12522
//Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful nonchalance, and said,
//“Well, you knew there had to be __some __trick to it, right? And now the
//heroine will mysteriously know where and when to find bullies - just like she
//listened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age could
//__possibly __have turned herself invisible to spy on them.”

// 12523
//There was a pause and a silence.

// 12524
//“Harry -” she said. “I’m - I’m not sure anymore that fighting bullies is such a
//good idea.”

// 12525
//Harry’s eyes stayed steady on hers. “Because the other girls might get hurt?”

// 12526
//She nodded, just nodded.

// 12527
//“That’s __their __choice, Hermione, just like it’s yours. __I
//__decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone does in books, try to
//keep you safe and protected and helpless, and have you get really angry at me,
//and push me away while you go off on your own and get into even more trouble,
//and then heroically pull through it successfully, after which I’d finally have
//my epiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that part of
//my life story goes, so I’m just skipping over it. If I can predict what I’m
//going to think later, I might as well go ahead and think it now. Anyway, my
//point is, you shouldn’t smother __your __friends to keep them safe,
//either. Just tell them up front it’s predictably going to go horribly wrong,
//and if they still want to be heroines after that, fine.”

// 12528
//It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was __ever __going
//to get used to the way Harry thought. “Harry, I really,” her voice stuck for a
//second, “really, __really __don’t want them getting hurt! Especially
//because of something I started!”

// 12529
//“Hermione,” Harry said seriously, “I’m pretty sure you did the right thing. I
//don’t see what could realistically happen to them that would be __worse
//__for them, in the long run, than__ not trying__.”

// 12530
//“What if they get __badly __hurt?” Hermione said. Her voice felt blocked
//in her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how Harry had just stared
//straight into the eyes of a bully as the bully bent his finger back, before
//Professor Sprout had arrived to save him; and there was another thought that
//came after that, about Hannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that
//she carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that wasn’t
//allowed to be imagined. “And then - they’ll never do anything courageous, ever
//again -”

// 12531
//“I don’t think it works like that,” Harry said steadily. “Even if it all goes
//mind-bogglingly wrong, I don’t think it works like that inside a human mind.
//The important thing is believing about yourself that you’re someone who can
//break your boundaries. Trying and getting hurt can’t possibly be worse for you
//than being… __stuck__.”

// 12532
//“What if you’re __wrong, __Harry?”

// 12533
//Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and said, “What if
//I’m right?”

// 12534
//Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand. From the inside
//the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against her palm, as if it was
//trying to give her hand a reassuring hug.

// 12535
//Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to Harry.

// 12536
//Harry didn’t move to take it.

// 12537
//“I -” said Hermione. “I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but I’m still
//thinking about it, so you can take it back for now. And… Harry, I don’t think
//it’s right to __spy __on people -”

// 12538
//“Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?” Harry said.
//“__I’ve__ never been bullied, but I’ve been through a realistic
//simulation, and it didn’t feel very pleasant. Have you ever been bullied,
//Hermione?”

// 12539
//“No,” she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry’s invisibility
//cloak to him.

// 12540
//Finally Harry took back his cloak - she felt a small twitch of loss as the
//inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind - and started to stuff the
//black material back into his pouch.

// 12541
//As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her, to break the
//Quieting Barrier -

// 12542
//“And, um,” Hermione said. “That’s not __the __Cloak of Invisibility, is
//it? The one we read about in the library on page eighteen of Paula Vieira’s
//translation of Gottschalk’s __An Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices__?”

// 12543
//Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in exactly the same
//tone of voice he’d used earlier with the other students at dinner, “I cannot
//confirm or deny that I possess magical artifacts of incredible power.”

// 12544
//When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying to decide. Her
//life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there hadn’t __been __any
//practical way for them to find bullies; and now she had to choose again; not
//for herself, this time, but for her friends. In her mind’s eye she kept seeing
//Dumbledore’s lined face and the pain it hadn’t quite hidden, and in her mind’s
//ears she kept hearing Harry’s voice saying ‘That’s their choice, Hermione, just
//like it’s yours.’

// 12545
//And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak against her fingers,
//replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a power to the feeling that
//compelled her thoughts to return to it, and to the song she’d heard / hadn’t
//heard in a part of her mind and magic which now lay silent once more.

// 12546
//Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a __person__, telling it to take
//good care of her. Harry had said the cloak had belonged to his father, that he
//couldn’t replace it if it was lost…

// 12547
//But… Harry wouldn’t __really __do that, would he?

// 12548
//Just __hand __her one of the three Deathly Hallows created centuries
//before Hogwarts?

// 12549
//She could say that she felt flattered, but this went __way __beyond
//feeling flattered, into making her wonder just what she was to Harry, exactly.

// 12550
//Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning ancient lost magical
//artifacts to __anyone __he considered a friend, but -

// 12551
//But when she thought about __which __part of his life Harry had said he’d
//skipped over, the part where he tried to keep her safe and protected…

// 12552
//Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm. Somewhere beyond her
//bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She’d turned up her Quieting Charm to where she
//couldn’t hear the exact words, but could still hear their faint murmur; there
//was something comforting about sleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry
//kept his own Quieter turned up all the way, she knew.

// 12553
//She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually __did__, well…

// 12554
//You know…

// 12555
//__Like __her.

// 12556
//It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that night.

// 12557
//And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip of parchment
//peeking out from under her pillow which said __At half-past ten you will
//find a bully in the fourth passageway to the left of the hall leaving the
//Potions classroom - S.__

// 12558
//When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach was filled with
//flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as she approached the
//Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn’t decided what to __do.__

// 12559
//There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be where to sit
//down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask Padma to tell Daphne and
//Tracey.

// 12560
//Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.

// 12561
//There were words waiting in her throat, __Padma, I got a____
//mysterious____ message -__

// 12562
//And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the words from coming
//out. She’d be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne __in danger__. Taking
//them and leading them by the hand straight into trouble. That was Wrong.

// 12563
//Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without telling her
//friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also Wrong.

// 12564
//Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just like all those
//wizards and witches she’d read about in stories. Only in stories people always
//got a __right __choice and a wrong choice, not two wrong ones, which
//seemed a bit unfair. But she had the sense, somehow - maybe it came from the
//way Harry always talked about how the history books would see them - that she
//was faced with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end up going
//one way or another, depending on what she chose right now, __this
//morning__.

// 12565
//Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side, just gazing at
//the plate and silverware like they might have answers hidden inside, thinking
//as hard as she ever had, and a few seconds later she heard Padma’s voice
//whispering almost in her ear, “Daphne says she knows where a bully’s going to
//be at ten-thirty today.”

// 12566
//Doomed.

// 12567
//They were all doomed, in Susan Bones’s opinion.

// 12568
//Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this, people doing
//something they __knew __was stupid, and the stories usually ended with
//someone being __doomed__ all over the floor and all over the walls and
//getting on Auntie’s shoes.

// 12569
//“Hey, Padma,” muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible over the soft
//impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor leading to the Potions
//classroom, “d’you know why Hermione’s been sighing all morning -”

// 12570
//“No talking!” hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding much louder than
//Parvati’s mutter. “You never know when Evil might be listening!”

// 12571
//__“Shhh!__” said three other girls even more loudly.

// 12572
//Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.

// 12573
//As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the Potions classroom,
//where Daphne’s mysterious informant had said the bullying would take place, the
//eight of them moved slower, the sound of their feet got softer, and finally
//General Granger made the gesture that meant __Halt, I’ll look ahead__.

// 12574
//Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look at her,
//Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight down the corridor, gestured to
//herself, and then tried to sign something else that Susan didn’t understand -

// 12575
//General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time with slower, more
//exaggerated movements, made the sign for __Halt, I’ll look ahead__.

// 12576
//Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they’d come, and made
//a bouncing gesture with her other hand.

// 12577
//Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender, and Susan
//thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of practice done two days
//ago wasn’t enough to remember a new set of code signals.

// 12578
//Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath Lavender’s feet, the
//expression on her face making it very clear that the intended meaning was
//__You. Stay. Here.__

// 12579
//Lavender nodded.

// 12580
//__Doom doom doom,__ went the words of the Chaos Legion’s marching song
//through Susan’s mind, __doom doom doom doom doom doom__…

// 12581
//Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the
//end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed, the Ravenclaw girl crept up
//to the wall, right next to where the passageway opened off the corridor, and
//peeked just the tip of the eyepiece around the corner.

// 12582
//Then a little more.

// 12583
//Then a little more.

// 12584
//Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the side.

// 12585
//General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the hand gesture for
//__follow me__.

// 12586
//Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the Plan which
//called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the bully had, apparently,
//actually worked. Maybe they were only __slightly __doomed…?

// 12587
//At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If anyone had been
//present to hear - though the corridor was apparently empty - they would have
//heard his shoes clicking solidly through the main corridor, entering the
//passageway, walking toward where the passageway turned its first corner,
//turning that corner, and then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the
//passageway now terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been before.

// 12588
//Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to watch the main
//passage from just around the corner.

// 12589
//It __was __the castle Hogwarts, after all.

// 12590
//Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they’d assembled into the outward
//appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not speaking, not moving, hardly
//even breathing, but watching through the eyeholes they’d left themselves.

// 12591
//As Susan’s gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening of her chest
//all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his seventh-year if not
//__older__, and his robes were trimmed in green instead of the red they’d
//been hoping for, and he had __muscles__, and after staring for a bit
//longer, Susan realized his stance had the balance that meant that he
//__dueled__.

// 12592
//Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the corridor. The
//fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been let out of Potions class.

// 12593
//The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the bully didn’t do
//anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of relief -

// 12594
//Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.

// 12595
//The bully still didn’t do anything, as the footsteps went past.

// 12596
//That happened a few more times.

// 12597
//And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one last set of
//footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully’s voice saying, clear and cold and
//quiet, “__Protego__”.

// 12598
//Someone __did __gasp then, though fortunately very very quietly. If they
//couldn’t get in even a single shot -

// 12599
//The bullies were learning __already__, Susan realized, she hadn’t expected
//S.P.H.E.W. to be able to do this very often before the bullies caught on - but
//- Hermione had already defeated three bullies - and the school had been buzzing
//with speculation about Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, yesterday -

// 12600
//__He’s expecting us!__

// 12601
//Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only there was no way
//to convey a message to -

// 12602
//“__Silencio__,” said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice with his wand
//pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his Shielding Charm shimmering
//around him. “__Accio__ victim.”

// 12603
//When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was dangling upside
//down as if an invisible hand were holding him high by one leg, his red-trimmed
//robes beginning to slide down his thighs to reveal the pants beneath. His mouth
//was opening and closing helpessly, no sound coming out.

// 12604
//“I suppose you’re wondering what’s going on,” the seventh-year Slytherin said
//in a quiet, cold voice. “Don’t worry. It’s so simple even a Gryffindor could
//understand.”

// 12605
//With that, the Slytherin’s left hand formed a fist and drove hard into the
//Gryffindor’s belly. The fourth-year boy’s body jerked around frantically, but
//still no words left his mouth.

// 12606
//“You’re my victim,” said the older Slytherin. “I’m a bully. I’m going to beat
//you up. And we’ll see if anyone stops me.”

// 12607
//It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.

// 12608
//And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and high-pitched voice
//of a young girl, crying, “__Stop, evildoer! Finite Incantatem!__”

// 12609
//__Lavender__, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl had volunteered
//to be a distraction, while the rest of them executed a flank attack from where
//the bully wouldn’t expect it, that had been the plan, only now -

// 12610
//“In the name of Hogwarts,” cried Lavender’s voice, though they couldn’t see
//her, “and in the name of heroines everywhere, I command you to let go of that
//EEK!”

// 12611
//“__Expelliarmus__,” said the bully. “__Stupefy__. __Accio
//__stupid heroine.”

// 12612
//When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot and unconscious,
//Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright crimson-and-gold skirt and
//blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts robes.

// 12613
//The bully was also giving the girl’s upside-down body an odd look, and then he
//pointed his wand at her and said “__Finite Incantatem__,” but the clothes
//stayed the same.

// 12614
//Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of Lavender instead
//of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his fist -

// 12615
//“__Lagann!__” yelled five voices, and five green spirals blasted from five
//wands aimed through five holes in the false wall, and an instant later
//Hermione’s voice shouted ”__Stupefy!__”

// 12616
//Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and Hermione’s red
//bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year boy, who jerked and then
//was still.

// 12617
//And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the first-year
//girls screamed and charged.

// 12618
//Susan’s eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from where she’d lain
//on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her whole body still aching from when
//she’d been hit, the battle had only moved forward a few seconds from what she
//could see, Hannah’s body falling with her arm still stretched out toward Susan,
//“__Glisseo!__” shouted Hermione but the older boy just slashed his wand
//down leaving a trail of green glow behind and Hermione’s Charm visibly
//disrupted into a shower of blue-white sparks, then in almost the same motion
//the bully said ”__Stupefy!__” and Hermione was blown backward and Susan
//summoned up all the magic she had left and shouted ”__Innervate!__” at
//Hermione’s body even as the bully turned toward her, the bully’s wand pointed
//in her direction again and then Padma yelled ”__Prismatis!__” just before
//the bully shouted ”__Impedimenta!__”, the rainbow sphere forming
//__around the bully __and the seventh-year Slytherin staggered as his own
//hex was reflected back at him, but an instant later the bully’s wand swept back
//to tap himself and then Padma’s Prismatic Sphere shattered like a blown soap
//bubble as the bully’s wand cut through it and ”__Innervate!__” yelled
//Parvati at Hannah’s body and Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time,
//”__Wingardium Leviosa!__” -

// 12619
//Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with exhaustion, she
//didn’t have enough magic left for even one __Innervate__, now.

// 12620
//The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying across the
//ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and Parvati in a heap against
//one wall, Susan standing in petrified rigor as her eyes tracked it all
//helplessly, even the Gryffindor boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had
//woken him and he’d fought, but it hadn’t been enough).

// 12621
//It had been a very short battle.

// 12622
//The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a wavering ripple
//in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads of sweat on his forehead.

// 12623
//The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and stalked toward
//her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.

// 12624
//Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in her choking
//throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake brick wall, ran down the
//passageway with all the speed she could muster, weaving as much as she could -

// 12625
//Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the bully’s voice from
//behind her said “__Cluthe!__” and she got awful cramps all through her
//legs, she fell down and slid and hit her head against the wall, only she didn’t
//even notice the pain of the smack as she started to scream with the twisting
//muscles -

// 12626
//The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she turned her head;
//approaching her slowly, still wearing that dreadful smile.

// 12627
//And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up around
//themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway, and screamed, “Go
//__away!__”

// 12628
//“I think not,” said the bully, his voice deep and scary like that of a grown
//man, sounding very close at hand now.

// 12629
//The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed her Most
//Ancient Blade directly into his groin.

// 12630
//There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor -

// 12631
//It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey’s office,
//leaving one of their own behind in a hospital bed.

// 12632
//Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the healer had said;
//torn muscles were easy to mend.

// 12633
//Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah had suffered a
//mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused the leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey
//had given them a sharp look but hadn’t argued, even though that Charm was
//around six years above their level.

// 12634
//Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her state of total
//magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any spells for the next three
//hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne using up too much magic trying to
//__Finite __Hannah, rather than the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of
//her power to break the __Protego__.

// 12635
//The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the bruises under their
//robes until they could get some older girls to cast __Episkey__. There
//were limits to what Daphne could talk around.

// 12636
//The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too close. If the
//bully had so much as looked around the corner - if he’d taken a moment to
//recast his Shielding Charm -

// 12637
//“We should stop,” said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had gotten out of
//hearing range of the healer’s office. “We should stop doing this.”

// 12638
//For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote on this sort of
//thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.

// 12639
//The Sunshine General didn’t seem to see them looking at her, she just strode
//on, gazing off straight ahead.

// 12640
//After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that sounded thoughtful
//and a little sad, “Hannah said __she __didn’t want us to stop. I’m not
//sure it’s right for us to… be less brave __for __her, than she is.”

// 12641
//All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.

// 12642
//“I think that’s got to be as bad as it gets,” said Parvati. “And we can handle
//it. We’ve proved that now.”

// 12643
//Susan couldn’t think of anything to say to that. She didn’t think that
//shrieking at the top of her lungs about blatant stupidity and DOOM would be
//persuasive. And she couldn’t just __leave __the other girls, either.
//Wasn’t it enough to be cursed with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs have to be
//__loyal __on top of everything else?

// 12644
//“By the way, Lavender,” said Padma. “What in the name of Merlin’s underpants
//were you __wearing __back there?”

// 12645
//“My hero outfit,” said the Gryffindor girl.

// 12646
//Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own head from where she
//was plodding through the hall. “It’s the costume of the Soldier of Gryffindor
//from the play __Chronicles of the Lunarian Soldiers__.”

// 12647
//“Did you Transfigure it?” said Parvati, looking puzzled. “But the bully cast
//__Finite __on you -”

// 12648
//“Nope!” Lavender said. “It’s __real!__ See, I just Transfigured my hero
//outfit into a regular shirt and skirt __beforehand__, so all I had to do
//was cast __Finite __on myself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own,
//Parvati? I got mine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for
//twelve Sickles -”

// 12649
//“I think,” General Granger said in a careful voice, “that would make us all
//look a little silly.”

// 12650
//“Well,” said Lavender, “we should vote on whether to -”

// 12651
//“I think,” General Granger said, “that no matter what __anyone __votes,
//I’m not going to be caught __dead __wearing one of those costumes -”

// 12652
//Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort of clever
//strategy for being less doomed.

// 12653
//The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as the seven of
//them walked into lunch.

// 12654
//Then the applause started.

// 12655
//It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone applauding at once. A
//lot of it came from the Gryffindor table, less from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw,
//and none from Slytherin.

// 12656
//Daphne felt her face tightening. She’d __hoped __- well, maybe after they
//found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin to rescue, her fellow
//Slytherins would realize -

// 12657
//She looked at the Hufflepuff table.

// 12658
//Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above his head,
//although he wasn’t smiling. Maybe he’d heard about Hannah, or maybe he was
//wondering why Hannah wasn’t there.

// 12659
//Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the Head Table.

// 12660
//Professor Sprout’s face was lined with concern. She and Professor McGonagall
//were leaning their heads toward Headmaster Dumbledore, who had a solemn look,
//and all their lips were moving quickly. Professor Flitwick looked more resigned
//than anything else, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his
//soup using a spoon gripped in a fist.

// 12661
//Professor Snape was looking directly at -

// 12662
//__Her?__

// 12663
//Or - at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?

// 12664
//A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master’s face, and he raised his hands,
//brought them together once in a motion that was too slow to be a real clap; and
//then the Potions Master turned back to his plate, ignoring the conversations
//around him.

// 12665
//Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily turned to walk
//toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and Parvati peeled off from
//their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables on the other
//side of the Great Hall.

// 12666
//It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table where the
//Slytherin Quidditch team sat.

// 12667
//That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled __hard __like she was
//being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the gap between where Marcus
//Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a sad little splutching sound as
//Hermione’s face ended up in Flint’s plate of steak and mashed potatoes.

// 12668
//Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was just Daphne
//herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a bellow of indignation and
//his hand yanked Hermione back and threw her into the Ravenclaw table, and she
//bounced off a student’s back and collapsed onto the ground -

// 12669
//The quiet spread out in ripples.

// 12670
//Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn’t get all the way to
//her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was shaking, and that her face
//was still covered with mashed potatoes with scattered pieces of steak.

// 12671
//For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in the whole Great
//Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could, what happened next.

// 12672
//Then Flint’s powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain that bellowed
//commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous rumble, “You ruined my
//food, girl.”

// 12673
//Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione’s head - Daphne could see it
//trembling - turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch Captain.

// 12674
//“Apologize to me,” said Flint.

// 12675
//Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw table, and then
//stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he’d just thought of something -

// 12676
//Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.

// 12677
//All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming into their
//hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor table and at the Hufflepuff
//table and without thinking Daphne turned to look at the Head Table and she saw
//that the Headmaster was still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore
//was __just watching __and he had one hand out as though to restrain
//Professor McGonagall - in just one second someone would shout a spell and then
//it would be too late, __why wasn’t the Headmaster doing anything __-

// 12678
//And a voice said, “My apologies.”

// 12679
//Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute shock.

// 12680
//“__Scourgify__,” said that smooth voice, and the mashed potatoes vanished
//from Hermione’s face, revealing the Ravenclaw’s surprised expression as Draco
//Malfoy approached her, sheathed his wand again, and then knelt to one knee
//beside her and offered her a hand.

// 12681
//“Sorry about that, Miss Granger,” said Draco Malfoy’s polite voice. “I guess
//someone thought they were being funny.”

// 12682
//Hermione took Draco’s hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what was about to
//happen -

// 12683
//But Draco Malfoy __didn’t __raise Hermione halfway up and then drop her.

// 12684
//He just pulled her to her feet.

// 12685
//“Thanks,” said Hermione.

// 12686
//“You’re welcome,” Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking to either side
//to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were staring at him in total shock.
//“Just remember, being cunning and ambitious doesn’t mean you have to be like
//that.”

// 12687
//And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin bench and sat down
//like he hadn’t - he hadn’t just - __he’d just __-

// 12688
//Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench and sat down.

// 12689
//A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.

// 12690
//“Daphne?” said Tracey. “Are you all right?”

// 12691
//Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it might explode
//right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like that curse Amycus Carrow had
//used once on a puppy.

// 12692
//Draco’s face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it’d been drilled
//into him over and over) that if he showed the slightest sign of the fear he was
//feeling, his Housemates would rip him apart like a swarm of Acromantulas.

// 12693
//There’d been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to plot, no time to
//think, just the instant of realizing that the time to start rescuing
//Slytherin’s reputation was __right then__.

// 12694
//From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared at Draco.

// 12695
//But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked puzzled.

// 12696
//“All right, I give up,” said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn’t recognize,
//sitting across from him and two places to his right. “Why did you do that,
//Malfoy?”

// 12697
//Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn’t swallow. That would have been a
//sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots, which had the most moisture of
//anything on his plate, and chewed and swallowed, thinking as rapidly as he
//could.

// 12698
//“You know,” Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could - as his heart
//thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around him stopped talking to
//listen - “there’s __probably __some way to make Slytherin look even
//__worse __than attacking eight first-year girls from all four Houses who
//are working together to stop bullies, but I can’t think of __how__. This
//way we get the benefit of what Greengrass is doing.”

// 12699
//The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.

// 12700
//“What?” said the sixth-year boy, and “Wait, __what __benefit?” said a
//fifth-year girl sitting to his right.

// 12701
//“It makes Slytherin House look better,” said Draco.

// 12702
//The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like he’d just tried
//to explain algebra.

// 12703
//“Look better to __who?__” said the sixth-year boy.

// 12704
//“But you just helped a __mudblood__,” said the fifth-year girl. “How’s
//__that s__upposed to look good?”

// 12705
//Draco’s throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous malfunction
//during which it couldn’t think of anything to say except the truth -

// 12706
//Then, “It’s probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme Malfoy’s got
//going,” said a fifth-year boy. “You know, like in __The Tragedy of
//Light__, where everything that looks like a setback is part of the plot. And it
//ends with Granger’s head on a stick and nobody suspecting that it was him.”

// 12707
//“__That __makes sense,” someone said from further down the table, and
//there was a lot of nodding.

// 12708
//“Do __you __know what the boss’s up to?” Vincent muttered in an undertone.

// 12709
//Gregory Goyle didn’t reply. In his mind he could hear very clearly his master’s
//voice, saying,__ I can’t believe I believed every word of that__, the day
//the rumor had started about Salazar Slytherin showing Potter and Granger where
//to find bullies.

// 12710
//“Mr. Goyle?” whispered Vincent.

// 12711
//Gregory Goyle’s lips shaped the words, __Oh no, __but no sound came out.

// 12712
//Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she hadn’t felt hungry.
//Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had kept burning through her mind,
//over and over, the feeling of her face squishing into the mashed potatoes and
//then being thrown through the air and then the Slytherin’s boy’s voice saying
//‘Apologize to me’… it might have been the first time in her whole life that
//she’d felt like __hating __someone. The boy who’d thrown her (Marcus
//Flint, they’d said his name was) and whoever had cast the tripping Jinx on her
//in the first place… she’d felt it, for one horrible instant she’d wanted to go
//tell Harry that if he started getting __creative __on her behalf, she
//wouldn’t object.

// 12713
//She hadn’t been a minute out of the Great Hall before she’d heard the sound of
//running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne racing toward her.

// 12714
//And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say…

// 12715
//“Don’t you __understand?__” Daphne’s voice was barely below a shriek.
//“Just because someone’s nice to you doesn’t mean they’re your friend! He’s
//__Draco Malfoy!__ His father’s a Death Eater, all the parents of all his
//friends are Death Eaters - Nott, Goyle, Crabbe, __everyone around him__,
//do you get it? They __all __despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like
//you to __die__, they think you’re good for nothing but being a
//__sacrifice __in horrible Dark rituals! Draco is __the next Lord
//Malfoy__, he’s been raised from birth to hate you and he’s been raised from
//birth to __lie!__” Daphne’s gray-green eyes stared fiercely at her,
//demanding assent and understanding.

// 12716
//“He -” Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop, the awful jolt as
//she started to fall, Draco Malfoy’s hand grabbing hers and holding it so hard
//that she’d had bruises afterward. She’d had to tell him twice before he finally
//let her fall. “Maybe Draco Malfoy isn’t like them -”

// 12717
//Daphne’s whisper was almost a scream. “If he __doesn’t __end up doing you
//ten times as hard as he just helped you, his __life __is __over__, do
//you understand? I mean Lucius Malfoy would __literally __disinherit him!
//D’you know what the chance is that he’s __not __up to something?”

// 12718
//“Tiny?” said Hermione in a small voice.

// 12719
//“__Zero!__” hissed Daphne. “I mean __none!__ I mean __less
//__than zero! I mean the chance is so small that you couldn’t find it with three
//Magnifying Charms and a Point-Me spell and - and - and an ancient map and a
//centaur prophet! Everyone in Slytherin knows he’s plotting to do something to
//you and doesn’t want to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seen pointing
//his wand at you just before you tripped - don’t you __see?__ __This
//is all part of Malfoy’s plan!__”

// 12720
//Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and Ashwinder sauce
//(it wasn’t made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just tasted like fire), trying not
//to laugh and trying not to cry.

// 12721
//He’d __heard __about plausible deniability, but hadn’t realized how much
//it mattered until he found that Malfoys didn’t have any.

// 12722
//“You want to know my plot?” said Draco. “__Here’s __my plot. I’m not going
//to do __anything__ and then the __next __time people think I’m
//plotting something, they won’t be sure.”

// 12723
//“Huh…” said the fifth-year boy. “I don’t think I believe you, that doesn’t
//sound cunning enough to be really it -”

// 12724
//“That’s what he __wants __you to think,” said the fifth-year girl.

// 12725
//“Albus,” Minerva said dangerously, “did you __plan __all this?”

// 12726
//“Well, if I __did __snap my fingers under the table, I wouldn’t just
//__tell __you that -”

// 12727
//The Defense Professor’s quavering hand dropped his spoon into the soup again.

// 12728
//“What do you mean, __set you up?__” said Millicent. The two of them were
//sitting cross-legged on Daphne’s bed, having come there straight from the Great
//Hall after lunch. “With my Seer’s eyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw
//you __winning__.”

// 12729
//Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather narrowed at the
//moment. “That boy was __expecting __us.”

// 12730
//“Well, yeah!” said Millicent. “Everyone knows you’re hunting bullies!”

// 12731
//“Hannah got hit by a really painful hex,” Daphne said. “She had to visit a
//healer, Millicent! If we’re friends you should’ve __warned __me!”

// 12732
//“Look, Daphne, I __told __you -” The Slytherin girl paused, as if trying
//to remember something, and then said, “I mean, I told you, what I See
//__has __to come to pass. If I try to change it, if __anyone __tries
//to change it, really terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will
//happen. And then it’ll come to pass __anyway__. If I See you getting
//beaten up, I __can’t __tell you that, because then you’d try to
//__not go__, and __then __-” Millicent stopped.

// 12733
//“And then?” Daphne said skeptically. “I mean, what happens if we just don’t
//go?”

// 12734
//“I don’t __know!__” said Millicent. “But it probably makes being eaten by
//Lethifolds look like a tea party!”

// 12735
//“Look, even I know that’s not how prophecies work,” Daphne said, then paused.
//“At least prophecies don’t work like that in plays…” Admittedly, there were all
//sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid a prophecy __made__ it happen, or
//where, on the other hand, trying to __go along __with a prophecy was the
//only reason why it happened. But you __could__ make prophecies happen your
//own way if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough could take
//your place; or with enough effort it was possible to break a prophecy outright…
//Then again, in plays the Seers never remembered what they Saw, either…

// 12736
//Millicent must have seen Daphne’s hesitation, because the other girl started
//looking a little more confident. “Well,” Millicent said sharply, “this isn’t a
//play! Look, I’ll tell you if I See it being a hard battle or an easy one. But
//that’s __all __I can do, you understand? And if I say ‘hard’ you
//__can’t __not show up! Or - or -” Millicent’s eyes rolled back in her
//head, and she intoned hollowly, “__Those who try to cheat their destinies
//will come to sad and gloomy ends -”__

// 12737
//Professor Sprout shook her head, her face looking tight.

// 12738
//“But -” said Susan. “But you helped __Harry Potter __that one time -”

// 12739
//“And it was made __quite clear __to me,” Professor Sprout said in a voice
//that sounded like someone was using a Shrinking Charm to squeeze her throat,
//“that it was Professor Snape’s job, and not mine, to keep order in Slytherin
//House - Miss Bones, __please__, you don’t have to __do __this if -”

// 12740
//“Yes, I __do __have to,” Susan said unhappily. “I’m a Hufflepuff, we have
//to be loyal.”

// 12741
//“A mysterious parchment under your pillow?” said Harry Potter, looking up from
//where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where they were studying. Then the
//boy’s green eyes narrowed. “It wasn’t from Santa Claus, was it?”

// 12742
//Pause.

// 12743
//“Okay,” said Hermione. “I’m __not __going to ask, and you’re __not
//__going to tell me, and we’re __both __going to pretend you never said that
//and I don’t know anything about it -”

// 12744
//Susan approached the table as soon as the older girl was alone, glancing around
//the Hufflepuff common room to make sure nobody was watching (the way Auntie had
//taught her to do it, so that it wouldn’t be obvious that she was looking).

// 12745
//“Hey, Susie,” said the seventh-year Hufflepuff. “Do you already need more -”

// 12746
//“Can I please talk to you privately for a bit?” Susan said.

// 12747
//Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently considered a
//promising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood ramrod straight in
//Professor Snape’s office, with his teeth clenched tight and sweat trickling
//down his spine.

// 12748
//“I distinctly recall,” said the Head of his House in a sardonic drawl, “that I
//warned you, and a number of others this very morning, that there were certain
//first-year girls who might prove annoying, if a fighter were __incautious
//__and allowed himself to be __taken by surprise__.”

// 12749
//Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.

// 12750
//“I -” said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew how ridiculous
//it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. “Sir, they shouldn’t have been able
//to -” One first-year-girl shouldn’t have been able to break his
//__Protego__, no matter what sort of ancient Charm she used - Greengrass
//must have had __help __-

// 12751
//But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn’t believe that.

// 12752
//“Oh, I quite agree,” murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with menace. “They
//shouldn’t have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy, whatever his plotting, has a
//point, Astorga. It cannot be good for the repute of Slytherin’s House if our
//fighters, rather than demonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!”
//Snape’s voice had risen. “It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated
//by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House, Astorga, or I
//would deduct points from you myself!”

// 12753
//Jaime Astorga’s fists clenched at his side, but he couldn’t think of a thing to
//say.

// 12754
//It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the presence of his
//Head of House.

// 12755
//And afterward, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw Severus Snape’s
//smile.

// 12756
//That evening Draco was visited by his father’s owl, Tanaxu, who wasn’t green
//but only because there weren’t such things as green owls. The best Father had
//been able to find was an owl of the purest silver feathers, with great luminous
//green eyes, and a beak as sharp and cruel as any snake’s fang. The parchment
//wrapped around Tanaxu’s leg was short and to the point:

// 12757
//__What are you doing, my son?__

// 12758
//The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it said,

// 12759
//__I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin’s reputation, father.__

// 12760
//In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to Malfoy Manor and
//back again, the family owl bore another message to Draco, and this one said
//only:

// 12761
//__What are you really doing?__

// 12762
//Draco stared at the parchment he’d unwrapped from the owl’s leg. His hands
//trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his fireplace. Five
//words, carved in black ink, shouldn’t have been scarier than death.

// 12763
//There wasn’t very much time to think. Father knew exactly how long it took for
//a message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and back again; he would know if
//Draco delayed to compose a careful lie.

// 12764
//But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before he wrote his
//reply, the only answer he’d thought of that Father might accept.

// 12765
//__I am preparing for the next war.__

// 12766
//Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl’s leg and tied it, and then sent
//Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls of Hogwarts, into the
//night.

// 12767
//He waited, but no reply came.
