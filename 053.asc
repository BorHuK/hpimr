//== The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 3

// 9360
//The corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbs gazed out at
//nothing.

// 9361
//“Mad,” Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, “It seems that little Bella is
//going mad…”

// 9362
//Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely, how he was to
//act in Bellatrix’s presence; how to form the pretense he would maintain in his
//mind.

// 9363
//__You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make Bellatrix fall
//in love with you, to bind her to your service.__

// 9364
//That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor Quirrell had said,
//because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy thought.

// 9365
//__She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You do not
//return her love, but consider her useful. She knows this.__

// 9366
//__She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called her your
//dear Bella.__

// 9367
//Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his parents: the cold
//amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that high-pitched voice of deathly hate.
//It didn’t seem at all difficult to guess what the Dark Lord would say.

// 9368
//“I hope you are __not__ mad, Bella dear,” said the chill whisper. “Mad is
//not useful.”

// 9369
//Bellatrix’s eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air.

// 9370
//“My… Lord… I waited for you but you did not come… I looked for you but I could
//not find you… you are alive…” All her words came out in a low mutter, if there
//was emotion in it, Harry could not tell.

// 9371
//“__Sshow her your face,__” hissed the snake at Harry’s feet.

// 9372
//Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility.

// 9373
//The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial expressions
//looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity, only cool, calm interest.
//(While in his core, Harry thought, __I will save you, I will save you no
//matter what…__)

// 9374
//“The scar…” muttered Bellatrix. “That child…”

// 9375
//“So they all still think,” said Harry’s voice, and gave a thin little chuckle.
//“You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella dear.”

// 9376
//(Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn’t be the one to play the part of
//the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed out that there was no
//plausible reason for __him__ to be possessed by the shade of
//He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)

// 9377
//Bellatrix’s eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word.

// 9378
//__“Ssay ssomething in Parsseltongue,” __hissed the snake.

// 9379
//Harry’s face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was addressing it,
//and hissed, “__One two three four five ssix sseven eight nine ten.__”

// 9380
//There was a pause.

// 9381
//“Those who do not fear the darkness…” murmured Bellatrix.

// 9382
//The snake hissed, “__Will be conssumed by it.__”

// 9383
//“Will be consumed by it,” whispered the chill voice. Harry didn’t particularly
//want to think about how Professor Quirrell had gotten that password. His brain,
//which thought about it anyway, suggested that it had probably involved a Death
//Eater, a quiet isolated place, and some lead-pipe Legilimency.

// 9384
//“Your wand,” murmured Bellatrix, “I took it from the Potters’ house and hid it,
//my lord… under the tombstone to the right of your father’s grave… will you kill
//me, now, if that was all you wished of me… I think I must have always wanted
//you to be the one to kill me… but I can’t remember now, it must have been a
//happy thought…”

// 9385
//Harry’s heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and - and he couldn’t
//cry, couldn’t let his Patronus fade -

// 9386
//Harry’s face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was sharp as it said,
//“Enough foolishness. You’re to come with me, Bella dear, unless you prefer the
//company of the Dementors.”

// 9387
//Bellatrix’s face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken limbs did not stir.

// 9388
//“__You’ll need to float her out,__” Harry hissed to the snake.
//”__Sshe can no longer think of esscaping.__”____

// 9389
//____

// 9390
//“__Yess,__” hissed the snake, ”__but do not underesstimate her, sshe
//wass the deadliesst of warriorss.__” The green head dipped in warning.
//”__One would be wisse to fear me, boy, even were I sstarved and
//nine-tenthss dead; be wary of her, allow no ssingle flaw in your pretensse.__”

// 9391
//The green snake smoothly glided out of the door.

// 9392
//And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful expression on his
//bearded face cringed into the room with his wand in hand.

// 9393
//“My Lord?” the servant said falteringly.

// 9394
//“Do as you were instructed,” the Dark Lord whispered in that chill voice,
//sounding even more terrible coming from a child’s body. “And do not let your
//Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not return there will be no reward for you,
//and it will be long before your family is allowed to die.”

// 9395
//Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his invisibility cloak
//over his head, and disappeared.

// 9396
//The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix’s cage, and pulled a tiny
//needle from his robes with which he poked the human skeleton. The single drop
//of red blood produced was soon absorbed into a small doll, which was laid upon
//the floor, and the servant began to chant in a whisper.

// 9397
//Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless. Afterward the
//servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from the empty air hissed an
//impatient command. Then the servant pointed his wand at Bellatrix and spoke a
//word, and the living skeleton lying on the bed was naked, and the skeleton
//lying on the floor was clothed in her faded dress.

// 9398
//The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it lay upon the
//seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful man then produced an empty
//glass flask with small traces of golden fluid clinging to its inside. This
//flask was concealed in a corner, the strip of skirt laid over it, the leached
//cloth nearly blending with the gray metal wall.

// 9399
//Another wave of the servant’s wand floated the human skeleton lying on the bed
//into the air, and in almost the same motion clothed her in new black robes. An
//ordinary-looking bottle of chocolate milk was put into her hand, and a chill
//whisper ordered Bellatrix to grasp the bottle and begin drinking it, which she
//did, her face still looking only puzzled.

// 9400
//Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself invisible, and
//they left. The door closed behind them all and clicked as it locked, plunging
//the corridor into darkness once more, unchanged but for a small flask concealed
//in the corner of one cell, and a fresh corpse lying upon its floor.

// 9401
//Earlier, in the deserted shop, Professor Quirrell had told Harry that they were
//going to commit the perfect crime.

// 9402
//Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard proverb that there
//was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he actually thought about it for
//two-thirds of a second, remembered a wiser proverb, and shut his mouth in
//midsentence.

// 9403
//__What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?__

// 9404
//If you __did__ commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever find out - so
//how could anyone possibly __know__ that there weren’t perfect crimes?

// 9405
//And as soon as you looked at it that way, you realized that perfect crimes
//probably got committed __all the time__, and the coroner marked it down as
//death by natural causes, or the newspaper reported that the shop had never been
//very profitable and had finally gone out of business…

// 9406
//When Bellatrix Black’s corpse was found dead in her cell the next morning,
//there within the prison of Azkaban from which (everyone knew) no one had ever
//escaped, nobody bothered doing an autopsy. Nobody thought twice about it. They
//just locked up the corridor and left, and the __Daily Prophet__ reported
//it in the obituary column the next day…

// 9407
//…that was the perfect crime which Professor Quirrell had planned.

// 9408
//And it wasn’t Professor Quirrell who screwed it up.
