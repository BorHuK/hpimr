//== Shut Up and Do The Impossible

// 19166
//The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the
//Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness, all these shone
//down upon the graveyard to bear witness from their unimaginable distances.

// 19167
//In the instant when Harry had realised there was no way at all left to save
//everyone, his mind’s voices had fallen away, become one, a single purpose
//taking up every fraction of his mind.

// 19168
//Fifty seconds.

// 19169
//Forty seconds.

// 19170
//Harry’s eyes tracked slowly across the air, until his gaze landed on the first
//Death Eater, the one closest to him.

// 19171
//Thirty seconds?

// 19172
//Twenty seconds?

// 19173
//“__Time’ss almosst up -”__ hissed Voldemort.

// 19174
//“__I do know ssecretss you would like to know,__” Harry hissed. He didn’t
//look directly at the Dark Lord as he spoke. ”__But mosst valuable
//knowledge to you, I think, would be my ideass ass to how world might be
//desstroyed. Yet, to tell you ssuch thoughtss might lead to desstruction of
//world. Do not know prophecy, but if there iss prophecy, that makess it more
//than ussually probable that any action I take might have that effect. Or to
//tell you ssuch might prevent desstruction of world, ssince you do sseem
//motivated to avoid it. Not allowed to make ssuch a decission mysself. Would
//need to awaken and conssult girl-child friend. Vow requiress.”__

// 19175
//There was a long pause. The Dark Lord, floating above and behind the curve of
//Death Eaters with leveled wands, began to laugh as Salazar Slytherin had
//thought a snake would laugh, cold amusement in the form of a hiss. “__Do
//you know how to desstroy world, then?__”

// 19176
//“__Cannot deliberately try to imagine method. You might have way for
//sservant to ssteal my thoughtss. Vow prohibitss. But ssusspect I could devisse
//method, if girl-child ssaid to try.__”

// 19177
//Harry’s eyes drifted slowly to another Death Eater, and another.

// 19178
//More snakish laughter. “__Clever. You have my complimentss for thinking
//of ssuch tacticss. But no.__”

// 19179
//“__Know it iss annoying, but with world and your eternity at sstake,
//would you not -”__

// 19180
//__“Greater rissk to world in introducing ssuch complicationss, delaying
//your end. I will sstudy Muggle ssciencess mysself, think of all you might
//imagine. Now sspeak ssuch ssecretss as you may tell me, or thiss endss.__”

// 19181
//Slowly Harry’s vision tracked across the graveyard in careful arcs, ignoring
//the Dark Lord except as a floating blackness in his peripheral vision. His
//mouth went on speaking with only half his attention. “__Have thought of
//idea you might not have conssidered, teacher. Your attempt to kill me might
//fail in certain sspecific way desspite all your precautionss, perhapss lead
//into my desstroying world later. Would not ordinarily deem probable, but with
//prophecy at hand, may well be sso.__”

// 19182
//Voldemort went still, in the air. “__How?__”

// 19183
//“__Am not obligated to tell you.__”

// 19184
//A cold anger began to seethe through the snakish reply. “__Though I
//undersstand well your dessperation and attempted clevernesss, thiss beginss to
//annoy me. I will not withhold from killing you, for that iss sstill greater
//rissk. To fail to tell me your thought rissks desstroying world. Sspeak!__”

// 19185
//“__No. Vow doess not obligate me to any possitive action.__”

// 19186
//The Dark Lord stared down at Harry Potter, who glanced up at the angry face
//only briefly before his eyes went back to the next Death Eater. Some of them
//were shifting their stances slightly, but they stood still, and said no words
//as they leveled their wands. The silver skull masks could not be read.

// 19187
//Then the Dark Lord began to chuckle again. “__Ssurvive your death, you
//think you might? No, child, my horcruxess are not linked to you alsso. I would
//know if they were. Or iss there other reasson you think you might ssurvive
//beyond my ways of enssuring your death?__”

// 19188
//Harry didn’t allow himself to be distracted. The repeated failures didn’t
//matter, they only led into the next action in the chain - but he __still
//needed a next action__ -

// 19189
//__“Now sspeak a ssecret,__” the Dark Lord hissed, ”__or I -”__

// 19190
//“__Life-eaterss will purssue you alwayss, hate you alwayss, sseek you out
//wherever you go, if what I have jusst done wass ssuccesssful, I have caused
//them to be set upon you! Guardian Charm ssecret will be beyond you for long
//time to come, perhapss forever! Besst defensse againsst life-eaterss would die
//with me!__”

// 19191
//“__Thiss iss sstarting to become ssad…__” the Dark Lord’s voice trailed
//off. __“Ah. I ssee. Life-eaterss resspond to expectationss. You tell me I
//will be hunted, I expect to be hunted, they hunt me. Ssuch iss rare, but not
//unheard-of. Valuable ssecret, yess. Can ssee many ussess.”__ A cruel smile.
//“__I sshall allow you to sselect one persson to be ssaved.__”

// 19192
//“__Mysself.__”

// 19193
//“__Would tell you to die with dignity, but knowing mysself, I know it for
//futility. You have wassted my kindly gift jusst then by annoying me, and I
//retract it. Any other ssecretss?__”

// 19194
//“__Yess. Really interessting oness, too. Ssome you are unlikely to figure
//out on your own, not for very long time if ever. If I ssay I have told you all
//that do not rissk world, will you not torment any of my friendss or family? All
//of thiss sspeech sstarted becausse you left me no way at all to ssave
//everyone.__”

// 19195
//The Dark Lord stood still in the air for a long moment.

// 19196
//And Harry’s eyes went on tracking slowly across the graveyard, as his hand
//remained tight upon his wand.

// 19197
//In the instant when Harry had realized there was no way left to save everyone -

// 19198
//He couldn’t speak any incantation in English. But Transfiguration was wordless.

// 19199
//There was no material in contact with his wand’s end except air, which couldn’t
//be Transfigured. But Voldemort didn’t know about partial Transfiguration, which
//Harry could use to Transfigure a tiny bit of the material from his wand itself.

// 19200
//“__You’re sstalling,”__ the Dark Lord said. “__Jusst to delay death?
//Or with other purposse?__”

// 19201
//Harry said nothing, his other work slowing as his mind sought a continuation of
//the conversation that would work even against the Dark Lord’s will -

// 19202
//__“Sspeak and tell me purposse, or thiss endss now and your friendss
//suffer for lifetimess!__”

// 19203
//“__Lower Muggle weapon and do not point wand in my direction,__” Harry
//hissed, putting as much cold danger as he could into the snake’s voice.
//__“Sspeak no commandss to sservantss. I do posssesss capabilitiess of
//which you are ignorant. Can usse one ssuch capacity to causse huge explossion
//almosst insstantly, without sspeaking incantation. Sslay your new body, all
//sservantss, Sstone sscattered to who knowss where.__”

// 19204
//At his current level of practice Harry could Transfigure one cubic millimeter
//as fast as he could apply his will and magic.

// 19205
//One cubic millimeter of antimatter.

// 19206
//It wasn’t a world-ending threat.

// 19207
//Voldemort could have been carved from stone. “__You bluff, ssomehow.__”

// 19208
//“__Not bluffing. Sspeaking in ssnaketalk, I tell you, I can do it almosst
//insstantly, before any sspell can be casst at me, I think. You know very little
//of sscience ass yet. Power I would command iss sstronger than processs that
//fuelss sstarss.”__

// 19209
//“__Vow will sstop you,” __hissed Voldemort. “__You cannot rissk
//world. Take no risskss, none, with clever ideass!__”

// 19210
//“__Would not rissk world. I esstimated ssize of explossion, nowhere near
//that large.__”

// 19211
//“__You do NOT know, fool! Cannot be SURE!__“Voldemort’s hiss was climbing
//higher.

// 19212
//“__I am reassonably certain. Vow will not sstop me.”__

// 19213
//There was an increasing fury in Voldemort’s expression, and yet his hiss
//carried a tinge of fear. __“I sshall wreak pain beyond imagining on all
//you care for -”__

// 19214
//__“Sshut up. I dissregard all ssuch threatss now, as theory of gamess
//ssayss I sshould. Only reasson you make threatss iss that you expect me to
//resspond.” __That, too, Harry had truly understood in the last extremity.
//__“Offer me ssomething I want, teacher. For your new body, for your
//continued holding of Sstone, for livess of your sservantss.__”

// 19215
//Harry’s mouth was running on automatic, his real attention elsewhere.

// 19216
//__Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a
//line…__

// 19217
//From a tiny spot on the end of Harry’s wand, a cubic millimeter of anchor,
//stretched out a thin line of Transfigured spider-silk. It would have broken at
//once, if tested; it would have gone unremarked, if any had noticed its glint.
//Less than a tenth of a millimeter in cross-section, the tiny shape represented
//by the extended line of spider-silk was something Harry could Transfigure
//swiftly, ten centimeters of length to a cubic millimeter of total volume; and
//Harry could Transfigure a cubic millimeter in a fraction of a second. He was
//forcing the Transfiguration outward, extending it through the air as fast as he
//could without risking the transformation.

// 19218
//The tracing line of spider-silk looped around a Death Eater’s hood at neck
//level, returned to the pattern of threads.

// 19219
//Voldemort’s face was now impassive. __“You musst not leave here alive.
//Ssenssible people called good would alsso agree, thiss I tell you in ssnake’ss
//sspeech. But all your friendss I will treat kindly and protect under my reign,
//if you agree to die now ass good persson sshould.”__

// 19220
//The last Death Eater was looped. The pattern of spider-silk was complete. The
//web had been drawn with loops around all the Death Eater’s necks. The ends of
//those loops had been anchored to a central circle; and that central circle in
//turn had three threads stretching across its center. The entire pattern still
//touching the anchor-line stretching out of Harry’s wand.

// 19221
//Over the next seconds, those near-invisible threads of reflected moonlight
//turned black.

// 19222
//Filaments narrower, stronger, and sharper than steel wire; braided carbon
//nanotubes, each individual tube all a single molecule.

// 19223
//Harry hissed, “__Want you to alsso promisse to treat nationss kindly
//under your rule. Will not accept lesss.”__

// 19224
//Voldemort hovered still in the air, snake-face showing a dawning fury.

// 19225
//The last two threads stretched out from the dark pattern, black theads already
//in the form of nanotubes. They moved lightly through the air toward the Dark
//Lord himself, toward the sleeve just above Voldemort’s left hand that held the
//gun, toward the sleeve above the right hand that held the yew wand, threads
//placed high at first to give them time to drift slowly downward through the
//air. The threads looped around, went over themselves, tied slippable knots.
//Began to tighten, coming closer to the sleeve, as Harry Transfigured them
//shorter -

// 19226
//Harry felt the tickle of Voldmort’s power beginning to touch his own in the
//back of his mind; at the same time the Dark Lord’s eyes widened, his mouth
//opened.

// 19227
//And Harry Transfigured the black threads stretching across the black pattern’s
//center to a quarter their previous size, shrinking the circle, yanking hard on
//everything attached, tightening loops.

// 19228
//__(Black robes, falling.)__

// 19229
//Harry wasn’t looking there, he didn’t see the falling masks, the blood, in the
//back of his mind he felt some explosions of magic like he’d felt when Hermione
//died but he ignored them, Harry’s eyes only saw the Dark Lord’s hands and wand
//and gun dropping downward, and then Harry’s wand was rising, pointing -

// 19230
//Harry screamed, __“STUPORFY!__”

// 19231
//The red bolt the color of the Stunning Hex winged toward Voldemort, blazing
//across the graveyard almost faster than the eye could see.

// 19232
//Without any hesitation despite his wounds the Dark Lord jerked down and right
//through the air.

// 19233
//And the red bolt from Professor Flitwick’s secret Swerving Stunner turned in
//midair and slammed into Voldemort.

// 19234
//The pain that flashed through Harry’s scar was searing, it made him cry out and
//a red haze appear across his vision, despite everything Harry dropped his wand
//in pain and sheer fatigue.

// 19235
//As Harry let go of his wand, the pain began to clear -
