//The third-generation quarks were also called “truth” and “beauty” before “top”
//and “bottom” won out; my birthdate is around Hermione’s, and when I was eleven,
//I used “truth” and “beauty”.
Кварки третього покоління також називали ``правда'' і ``краса'' перед тим, як
перемогли ``верхній'' і ``нижній''. Мій день народження недалеко від
Герміонового, і коли мені було одинадцять, я називав їх ``правда'' і ``краса''.

//Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a quick look at
//the face than anything else. He was still trying to get himself under control
//from his encounter with the ghosts. The sad, the really sad, the really truly
//sad thing was that he __did__ seem to be getting himself under control
//again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe a
//whole lifetime. Maybe just never.
Гаррі поглянув на свого нового однокласника, він намагався розгледіти обличчя,
решта його не дуже цікавила. Гаррі досі намагався опанувати себе після зустрічі
з привидами. Сумним, дійсну сумним, справді дійсно сумним було те, що схоже він
__почав опановувати__ себе знову. Це здавалося недоречним.  Певно він мав би
витратити день на це. А може все життя. А може взагалі вічність.

//At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor McGonagall, looking
//sharp and looking sharply around, as she called out one name after another,
//though she had smiled only for Hermione and a few others. Behind her, in the
//tallest chair at the table - really more of a golden throne - sat a wizened and
//bespectacled ancient, with a silver-white beard that looked like it would go
//almost to the floor if it were visible, watching over the Sorting with a
//benevolent expression; as stereotypical in appearance as a Wise Old Man could
//possibly be, without actually being Oriental. (Though Harry had learned to be
//wary of stereotypical appearances from the first time he’d met Professor
//McGonagall and thought that she ought to cackle.) The ancient wizard had
//applauded every student Sorted, with an unwavering smile that somehow seemed
//freshly delighted for each.
// @ Head Table
За кафедрою перед величезним головним столом стояла професорка Макґонеґел, що
мала суворий вигляд і суворо роздивлялася довкола. Вона кликала учнів одного за
іншим, хоча посміхнулася лише Герміоні й декільком іншим. За нею, у найвищому
стільці за столом -- більш схожому на золотий трон -- сидів висохлий старий в
окулярах, у нього була срібно-біла борода, що певно торкалася б підлоги, якби
її було видно.  Він доброзичливо спостерігав за сортуванням. За виглядом --
живе втілення стереотипу Мудрого Старця, тільки без елементів Сходу. (Хоча
Гаррі був навчився ставитися з недовірою до стереотипних виглядів, відколи
зустрів професорку Макґонеґел і гадав, що та має ґелґотати.) Древній чарівник
аплодував кожному розподіленому студентові, з непохитною усмішкою, що якимось
чином здавалася новою й щиро щасливою для кожного.

//To the golden throne’s left side was a man with sharp eyes and a dour face who
//had applauded no-one, and who somehow managed to be looking straight back at
//Harry every time Harry looked at him. Further to the left, the pale-faced man
//Harry had seen in the Leaky Cauldron, whose eyes darted around as though in
//panic at the surrounding crowd, and who seemed to occasionally jerk and twitch
//in his seat; for some reason Harry kept finding himself staring at him. To that
//man’s left, a string of three older witches who didn’t seem much interested in
//the students. Then to the right side of the tall golden chair, a round-faced
//middle-aged witch with a yellow hat, who had applauded every student except the
//Slytherins. A tiny man standing on his chair, with a poofy white beard, who had
//applauded every student, but smiled only upon the Ravenclaws. And on the
//farthest right, occupying the same space as three lesser beings, the
//mountainous entity who’d greeted them all after they’d disembarked from the
//train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds.
Ліворуч від золотого трону сидів чоловік з пронизливими очима й похмурим обличчям,
що нікому не аплодував і якимось чином щоразу, коли Гаррі дивився на нього, той
дивився прямо на нього. Далі ліворуч був чоловік з блідим обличчям, що його Гаррі
був бачив у Дірявому Казані, чиї очі роззиралися навколо натовпу, ніби в паніці, і
здавалося, що він подеколи сіпається й смикається на стільці; чомусь Гаррі весь
час на нього витріщався. Ще ліворуч були три

//“Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?” Harry whispered
//towards Hermione.

// 1261
//For once Hermione didn’t answer this instantly; she was shifting constantly
//from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and fidgeting so energetically
//that Harry thought her feet might be leaving the floor.

// 1262
//“Yes, he is,” said one of the prefects who’d accompanied them, a young woman
//wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if Harry recalled correctly.
//Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge of pride. “That is the Charms
//Professor of Hogwarts, Filius Flitwick, the most knowledgeable Charms Master
//alive, and a past Duelling Champion -”

// 1263
//“Why’s he so __short?__” hissed a student whose name Harry didn’t recall.
//“Is he a __halfbreed?__”

// 1264
//A chill glance from the young lady prefect. “The Professor does indeed have
//goblin ancestry -”

// 1265
//“What?” Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione and four other students to
//hush him.

// 1266
//Now Harry was getting a surprisingly intimidating glare from the Ravenclaw
//prefect.

// 1267
//“I mean -” Harry whispered. “Not that I have a __problem__ with that -
//it’s just - I mean - how’s that __possible?__ You can’t just mix two
//different species together and get viable offspring! It ought to scramble the
//genetic instructions for every organ that’s different between the two species -
//it’d be like trying to build,” they didn’t have cars so he couldn’t use a
//scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, “a half-carriage half-boat or something…”

// 1268
//The Ravenclaw prefect was still looking at Harry severely. “Why
//__couldn’t__ you have a half-carriage half-boat?”

// 1269
//“__Hssh!__” hsshed another prefect, though the Ravenclaw witch had still
//spoken quietly.

// 1270
//“I mean -” Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out how to ask
//whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from a common ancestor of
//humans like __Homo erectus__, or if goblins had been __made__ out of
//humans somehow - if, say, they were still genetically human under a heritable
//enchantment whose magical effect was diluted if only one parent was a ‘goblin’,
//which would explain how interbreeding was possible, and in which case goblins
//would __not__ be an incredibly valuable second data point for how
//intelligence had evolved in other species besides __Homo sapiens__ - now
//that Harry thought about it, the goblins in Gringotts __hadn’t__ seemed
//very much like genuinely alien, nonhuman intelligences, nothing like Dirdir or
//Puppeteers - “I mean, where did goblins __come__ from, anyway?”

// 1271
//“Lithuania,” Hermione whispered absently, her eyes still fixed firmly on the
//Sorting Hat.

// 1272
//Now Hermione was getting a smile from the lady prefect.

// 1273
//“Never mind,” whispered Harry.

// 1274
//At the lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, “Goldstein, Anthony!”

// 1275
//“RAVENCLAW!”

// 1276
//Hermione, next to Harry, was bouncing on her tiptoes so hard that her feet were
//actually leaving the ground on each bounce.

// 1277
//“Goyle, Gregory!”

// 1278
//There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost a minute.

// 1279
//“SLYTHERIN!”

// 1280
//“Granger, Hermione!”

// 1281
//Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt towards the Sorting Hat, picked it up
//and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over her head, making Harry
//wince. Hermione had been the one to explain to __him__ about the Sorting
//Hat, but she certainly didn’t __treat__ it like an irreplaceable, vitally
//important, 800-year-old artefact of forgotten magic that was about to perform
//intricate telepathy on her mind and didn’t seem to be in very good physical
//condition.

// 1282
//“RAVENCLAW!”

// 1283
//And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn’t see why Hermione had
//been so tense about it. In what weird alternative universe would that girl
//__not__ be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If Hermione Granger didn’t go to
//Ravenclaw then there was no good reason for Ravenclaw House to exist.

// 1284
//Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer; Harry wondered
//whether the cheer would have been louder, or quieter, if they’d had any idea
//just what level of competition they’d welcomed to their table. Harry knew pi to
//3.141592 because accuracy to one part in a million was enough for most
//practical purposes. Hermione knew one hundred digits of pi because that was how
//many digits had been printed in the back of her maths textbook.

// 1285
//Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. If that House
//really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was supposed to exemplify,
//then a Houseful of reliable friends would do Neville a whole world of good.
//Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor,
//and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.

// 1286
//(Though Harry __had__ been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The
//young woman hadn’t even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just
//jabbed a wand in Neville’s direction and muttered something. After which
//Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage
//from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had
//contained his toad.)

// 1287
//“Malfoy, Draco!” went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of relief.
//It had __seemed__ like a sure thing, but you never did know what tiny
//event might upset the course of your master plan.

// 1288
//Professor McGonagall called “Perks, Sally-Anne!”, and from the gathered
//children detached a pale waifish girl who looked oddly ethereal - like she
//might mysteriously disappear the moment you stopped looking at her, and never
//be seen again or even remembered.

// 1289
//And then (with a note of trepidation so firmly kept from her voice and face
//that you’d have needed to know her very well indeed to notice) Minerva
//McGonagall inhaled deeply, and called out, “Potter, Harry!”

// 1290
//There was a sudden silence in the hall.

// 1291
//All conversation stopped.

// 1292
//All eyes turned to stare.

// 1293
//For the first time in his entire life, Harry felt like he might be having an
//opportunity to experience stage fright.

// 1294
//Harry immediately stomped down this feeling. Whole room-fulls of people staring
//at him was something he’d have to accustom himself to, if he wanted to live in
//magical Britain, or for that matter do anything else interesting with his life.
//Affixing a confident and false smile to his face, he raised a foot to step
//forwards -

// 1295
//“Harry Potter!” cried the voice of either Fred or George Weasley, and then
//“Harry Potter!” cried the other Weasley twin, and a moment later the entire
//Gryffindor table, and soon after a good portion of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff,
//had taken up the cry.

// 1296
//__“Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!__”

// 1297
//And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much too slowly, he realized once he’d begun,
//but by then it was too late to alter his pace without it looking awkward.

'''

// 1298
//“__Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!”__

// 1299
//With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva McGonagall turned to
//look behind herself at the rest of the Head Table.

// 1300
//Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with curiosity, Hagrid
//clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and Sinistra bemused, and
//Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus smiling benevolently. And Severus
//Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the silver
//was slowly deforming.

// 1301
//With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then the other as he
//walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter walked forwards at a grandly
//measured pace, a prince inheriting his castle.

// 1302
//__“Save us from some more Dark Lords!”__ called one of the Weasley twins,
//and then the other Weasley twin cried, __“Especially if they’re
//Professors!” __to general laughter from all the tables except Slytherin.

// 1303
//Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with the Weasley
//Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was powerless because it was
//the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to take away. If they
//didn’t care about detentions then she would find something else.

// 1304
//Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus’s direction,
//__surely__ he realized the Potter boy must have no idea who that was
//talking about -

// 1305
//Severus’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indifference. A
//faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the direction of Harry
//Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a
//former wine goblet.

'''

// 1306
//Harry Potter walked forwards with a fixed smile, feeling warm inside and sort
//of awful at the same time.

// 1307
//They were cheering him for a job he’d done when he was one year old. A job he
//hadn’t really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord was still alive.
//Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew that?

// 1308
//But the Dark Lord’s power __had __been broken once.

// 1309
//And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecy and that
//was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darn prophecy said.

// 1310
//All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry couldn’t stand to
//let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child prodigies. To be
//a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation as a symbol of the
//Light, never mind __how__ he’d gotten it. He would absolutely, positively,
//no matter how long it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their
//expectations. And then go on to __exceed__ those expectations, so that
//people wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of him.

// 1311
//__“HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER!”__

// 1312
//Harry took his last steps towards the Sorting Hat. He swept a bow to the Order
//of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned and swept another bow to the
//other side of the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die away.

// 1313
//(In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely
//__conscious__ in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so,
//whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per
//year. Its song had implied so: __Oh, I’m the Sorting Hat and I’m okay, I
//sleep all year and I work one day…__)

// 1314
//When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stool and
//__carefully__ placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact of
//forgotten magic.

// 1315
//Thinking, just as hard as he could: __Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions
//I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when
//he was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I
//got the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Is the Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my
//scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
//questions, but if you’ve got another moment can you tell me anything about how
//to rediscover the lost magics that created you?__

// 1316
//Into the silence of Harry’s spirit, where before there had never been any voice
//but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, sounding distinctly worried:

// 1317
//__“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”__
