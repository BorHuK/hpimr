//== Egocentric Bias

// 5952
//Unfortunately, no one can be told who J. K. Rowling is. You have to see her for
//yourself.

// 5953
//Science disclaimers: Luosha points out that the theory of empathy in Ch. 27
//(you use your own brain to simulate others) isn’t quite a known scientific
//fact. The evidence so far points in that direction, but we haven’t analyzed the
//brain circuitry and proven it. Similarly, timeless formulations of quantum
//mechanics (alluded to in Ch. 28) are so elegant that I’d be shocked to find the
//final theory had time in it, but they’re not established yet either.

// 5954
//There’d been a sinking feeling in Hermione’s stomach lately, every time she
//heard the other students talking about her and Harry. She’d been in a shower
//stall this morning when she’d overheard a conversation between Morag and Padma
//that had been the last straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws.

// 5955
//She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry with Harry Potter
//had been a terrible mistake.

// 5956
//If she’d just __stayed away__ from Harry Potter, she could have been
//Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of Hogwarts, who was earning more
//points for Ravenclaw than anyone. She wouldn’t have been __as__ famous as
//the Boy-Who-Lived, but she would have been famous for __herself__.

// 5957
//Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name happened to be
//Hermione Granger.

// 5958
//And worse, she had gone on a date with him.

// 5959
//The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an appealing idea
//at first. She’d read books like that, and if there was anyone in Hogwarts who
//was a candidate for the heroine’s love interest it was obviously Harry Potter.
//Bright, funny, famous, sometimes scary…

// 5960
//So she’d forced Harry into going on a date with her.

// 5961
//And now __she__ was __his__ love interest.

// 5962
//Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.

// 5963
//She’d been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn on the water,
//when she’d heard giggles coming from outside. And she’d heard Morag talking
//about how that Muggleborn girl probably wouldn’t fight hard enough to win
//against Ginevra Weasley, and Padma speculating that Harry Potter might decide
//he wanted __both__.

// 5964
//It was like they didn’t understand that GIRLS had options on their dinner menu
//and BOYS fought over them.

// 5965
//But that wasn’t even the part that hurt, really. It was that when she scored 98
//on one of Professor McGonagall’s tests, the news wasn’t that Hermione Granger
//had scored the highest in the class, the news was that Harry Potter’s rival had
//scored seven more points than him.

// 5966
//If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of his story.

// 5967
//You didn’t get your own.

// 5968
//And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk away, but that
//would’ve been too sad.

// 5969
//But she did want to get __back__ what she’d accidentally given away by
//letting herself become known as Harry’s rival. She wanted to be a separate
//person again instead of Harry Potter’s third leg, was that too much to ask?

// 5970
//It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter how high you
//scored in class, even if you did something that deserved a special dinnertime
//announcement, it just meant you were rivaling Harry Potter again.

// 5971
//But she thought she’d come up with a way.

// 5972
//Something to do that __wouldn’t__ be seen as pushing up on the opposite
//end of Harry Potter’s seesaw.

// 5973
//It would be hard.

// 5974
//It would go against her nature.

// 5975
//She would have to fight someone very evil.

// 5976
//And she would need to ask someone even __more__ evil for help.

// 5977
//Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.

// 5978
//She hesitated.

// 5979
//Hermione realized she was being __silly__, and raised her hand a bit
//higher.

// 5980
//She tried to knock again.

// 5981
//Her hand quite failed to touch the door.

// 5982
//And then the door swung open anyway.

// 5983
//“Dear me,” said the spider, sitting in its web. “Was it really that hard to
//lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?”

// 5984
//Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing pink. It
//__had__ been.

// 5985
//“Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful,” said the evil Professor Quirrell.
//“Consider it already lost. There, I have taken a hard choice from you. Are you
//not grateful?”

// 5986
//“Professor Quirrell,” Hermione managed to say in a voice that squeaked a
//little. “I have a lot of Quirrell points, don’t I?”

// 5987
//“You do indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “Though one less than you had before.
//Terrible, isn’t it? Just think, if I don’t like your reason for coming here,
//you could lose another fifty. Maybe I’d take them away one… by one… by one…”

// 5988
//Hermione’s cheeks were going even redder. “You’re really evil, did anyone ever
//tell you that?”

// 5989
//“Miss Granger,” Professor Quirrell said gravely, “it can be dangerous to give
//people compliments like that when they have not been truly earned. The
//recipient might feel bashful and undeserving and want to do something worthy of
//your praise. Now what was it you wanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?”

// 5990
//It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry were ensconced
//in a little library nook, with a __Quietus__ field up so they could talk.
//Harry was lying stomach-down on the ground with his elbows resting on the floor
//and his head in his hands and his feet kicking up casually behind him. Hermione
//was occupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, like she was the Hermione
//center of a candy shell.

// 5991
//Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just the
//__titles__ of all the books in the library, and then Hermione could read
//all the tables of contents.

// 5992
//Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She’d never done that with a
//library before.

// 5993
//Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.

// 5994
//Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.

// 5995
//Hermione was reading a book called __Magical Mnemonics.______

// 5996
//____

// 5997
//Harry was reading a book called __The Skeptical Wizard.______

// 5998
//____

// 5999
//Each had thought it was just one special exception they would make only this
//one time, and neither had yet realized it was impossible for either of them to
//ever finish reading all the book titles no matter how hard they tried.

// 6000
//The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.

// 6001
//“Oh, __no__,” Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like the words had
//been torn out of him.

// 6002
//There was a bit more quiet.

// 6003
//“He __didn’t__,” Harry said, in the same voice.

// 6004
//Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.

// 6005
//Hermione looked up from her book.

// 6006
//“All right,” she said, “what __is__ it?”

// 6007
//“I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the family rat,” Harry
//said. “It’s __really__ awful and I shouldn’t be laughing and I’m a
//terrible person.”

// 6008
//“Yes,” Hermione said primly, “you are. Tell me too.”

// 6009
//“Okay, first the background. There’s a whole chapter in this book about Sirius
//Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that is, right?”

// 6010
//“Of course,” said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend of James
//Potter who had let Voldemort into the protected home of the Potters.

// 6011
//“So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say, __irregularities__,
//associated with Black going to Azkaban. He didn’t get a trial, and the Junior
//Minister in charge when the Aurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius
//Fudge, who became our current Minister of Magic.”

// 6012
//That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said as much.

// 6013
//Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on the floor
//looking at his book. “Suspicious things happen all the time, and if you’re a
//conspiracy theorist you can always find __something__.”

// 6014
//“But __no trial?__” said Hermione.

// 6015
//“It was right after the Dark Lord’s defeat,” Harry said, his voice serious as
//he said it. “Things were incredibly chaotic, and when the Aurors tracked down
//Black he was standing there laughing in a street ankle-deep in blood, with
//twenty eyewitnesses to recount how he’d killed a friend of my father’s named
//Peter Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I’m not saying I approve of Black not
//getting a trial. But these are wizards we’re talking about here, so it’s not
//really any more suspicious than, I don’t know, the sort of thing people point
//to when they want to argue over who shot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius
//Black is the wizarding Lee Harvey Oswald. There’s all sorts of conspiracy
//theories about who __really__ betrayed my parents instead of him, and one
//of the favorites is Peter Pettigrew, and this is where it starts getting
//complicated.”

// 6016
//Hermione listened, fascinated. “But how do you go from there to the Weasleys’
//__pet rat__ -”

// 6017
//“Hold on,” said Harry, “I’m getting there. Now, after Pettigrew’s death it came
//out that he’d been a spy for the Light - not a double agent, just someone who
//snuck around and found things out. He’d been good at that since he was a
//teenager, even in Hogwarts he had a reputation for finding out all sorts of
//secrets. So the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrew became an unregistered
//Animagus while he was still in Hogwarts, an Animagus of something small that
//could scurry around and listen to conversations. The main problem being that
//successful Animagi are rare and doing it as a teenager would be really
//unlikely, so of course the conspiracy theory says that my father and Black were
//unregistered Animagi too. And in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself
//killed the twelve bystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. So
//Michael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this. One, Black
//was the only one besides my parents who knew how to get through the wards
//around their house.” (Harry’s voice was a little hard as he said that.) “Two,
//Black was a more likely suspect to start with than Pettigrew, there’s a rumor
//Black deliberately tried to get a student killed during his time at Hogwarts,
//and he was from this really nasty pureblood family, Bellatrix Black was
//literally his cousin. Three, Black was twenty times the fighting wizard that
//Pettigrew was, even if he wasn’t as smart. The duel between them would have
//been like Professor Quirrell versus Professor Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn’t
//even get a chance to draw his wand, let alone fake all the evidence the
//conspiracy theory requires. And four, Black was standing in the street
//__laughing.__”

// 6018
//“But the __rat__ -” said Hermione.

// 6019
//“Right,” Harry said. “Well, to make a long story short, Bill Weasley decided
//that his little brother Percy’s pet rat was Pettigrew’s Animagus form -”

// 6020
//Hermione’s jaw dropped.

// 6021
//“Yes,” Harry said, “you wouldn’t exactly expect Evil Pettigrew to be living a
//sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy wizarding family, he’d either
//be with the Malfoys or, more likely, off in the Carribean after a bit of
//plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill knocks out his little brother Percy, stuns and
//grabs the rat, sends out all these emergency owl messages -”

// 6022
//“Oh, __no!__” Hermione said, the words torn out of her.

// 6023
//“- and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister of Magic, and the
//Head Auror -”

// 6024
//“He __didn’t!__” said Hermione.

// 6025
//“And of course when they get there they think he’s crazy, but they use
//__Veritas Oculum __on the rat anyway, just to be sure, and what do they
//discover?”

// 6026
//She would’ve __died__. “A rat.”

// 6027
//“You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St. Mungo’s and it
//turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic break, it just happens to some
//people, especially young men around what we’d consider college age. Guy was
//convinced he was ninety-seven years old and had died and gone back in time to
//his younger self via train station. And he responded perfectly well to
//antipsychotics and is back to normal and everything’s fine now, except people
//don’t talk as much anymore about Sirius Black conspiracy theories, and you
//don’t ever ask the Weasleys about the family rat.”

// 6028
//Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and she shouldn’t be
//laughing and she was a terrible person.

// 6029
//“The thing I __don’t__ understand,” Harry said, after their giggles had
//died down, “is __why__ Black would hunt down Pettigrew instead of running
//as fast as he could. He had to know the Aurors would be after him. I wonder if
//they got the reason out of Black before they took him to Azkaban? See, this is
//why people who are absolutely positively guilty still go through the legal
//system and get trials.”

// 6030
//Hermione had to agree with that.

// 6031
//Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only halfway through hers
//- hers was a much more difficult book than Harry’s, but she still felt
//embarrassed about that. And then she had to put __Magical Mnemonics__ back
//on the shelf and drag herself away, because it was time for her to face the
//most dreaded class in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.

// 6032
//Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own class wasn’t until
//an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet escorting a sad little propeller
//plane on its way to its own funeral.

// 6033
//The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and she walked onto
//the grassy fields of Doom.

// 6034
//And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible brushes with death
//and the ground in completely the __wrong place__ and the sun getting in
//her eyes and Morag buzzing her and Mandy thinking she was being __subtle__
//about always being near enough to catch her if she fell and she __knew__
//the other students were laughing at both of them but she never said anything to
//Mandy because she didn’t actually want to die.

// 6035
//After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on the ground where
//she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she had nightmares about it always
//being Thursday.

// 6036
//__Why__ everyone had to learn this, when they were just going to Apparate
//or Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up, was a complete and utter
//mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually needed to ride broomsticks as an adult, it
//was like being forced to play dodgeball in P.E.

// 6037
//At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at it.

// 6038
//It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff study hall with
//Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor Flitwick, surprisingly diffident
//for a teacher, had asked if she might possibly maybe help those four with their
//Charms homework for a while, even though they weren’t Ravenclaws, and Hermione
//had felt so proud she’d almost __burst__.

// 6039
//Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink on it, tore it
//into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the pieces on the table.

// 6040
//__She__ could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but doing all that
//made it more like garbage, and that helped when someone was first practicing
//the Disposal Charm.

// 6041
//Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, “Okay, try it.”

// 6042
//“__Everto.__”

// 6043
//“__Everto.__”

// 6044
//“__Everto.__”

// 6045
//“__Everto.__”

// 6046
//Hermione didn’t think she’d quite caught all the problems. “Can you all try it
//again?”

// 6047
//An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan were sort of
//sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing something, they would, (2)
//Hannah and Susan were focused and driven to the point where you had to keep
//telling them to __slow down__ and __relax__ and __think__ about
//things instead of __trying__ so hard - it was odd to think that those two
//would soon be __hers__ - and (3) she liked helping Hufflepuffs, the whole
//study hall had a very cheerful atmosphere.

// 6048
//When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a book while he
//waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and also a little worried
//because Harry didn’t seem to really talk to __anyone__ besides her.

// 6049
//“Did you know there’s a girl in Hufflepuff who’s a Metamorphmagus?” said
//Hermione as they headed toward the Great Hall. “She makes her hair really red,
//like stopsign red not Weasley red, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she
//turned into a black-haired boy until she got it under control again.”

// 6050
//“Really? Cool,” said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. “Um, Hermione, just to
//check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign up for Professor Quirrell’s
//armies, right?”

// 6051
//“Yes,” Hermione said. “The armies of the evil Professor Quirrell.” Her voice
//was a little angry, though Harry didn’t know why, of course.

// 6052
//“Hermione,” Harry said, his voice exasperated, “he’s not evil. He’s a little
//bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It’s not the same as being __evil__.”

// 6053
//Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his problem. He would have
//been better off if he’d just divided the universe into Good and Bad. “Professor
//Quirrell called me up in front of the whole class and told me to __shoot
//someone!__”

// 6054
//“He was right,” Harry said, his face sober. “I’m sorry, Hermione, but he was.
//You should have shot __me,__ I wouldn’t have minded. You can’t learn
//Battle Magic if you can’t practice against real opponents using real spells.
//And now you’re doing okay in sparring, aren’t you?”

// 6055
//Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn’t put it into words,
//she couldn’t find the thing to say that would convince Harry.

// 6056
//Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that girl in front of
//everyone, and ordered her to open fire without provocation on a classmate.

// 6057
//It didn’t __matter__ if Professor Quirrell was right about her needing to
//learn it.

// 6058
//Professor McGonagall wouldn’t ever have done that.

// 6059
//Professor Flitwick wouldn’t ever have done that.

// 6060
//Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.

// 6061
//Professor Quirrell was __EVIL__.

// 6062
//But she couldn’t find the words, and she knew that Harry would never believe
//her.

// 6063
//“Hermione, I’ve talked to older students,” Harry said. “Professor Quirrell
//could be the __only__ competent Defense Professor we get in all seven
//years at Hogwarts. Anything else we can learn later. If we want to study
//Defense, we have to do it __this year.__ The students who sign up for the
//extracurricular stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way beyond what
//the Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study - did you know we’re
//going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In __January?__”

// 6064
//“The __Patronus Charm?__” Hermione said, her voice going up in surprise.

// 6065
//Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a weapon against the
//Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive emotions. It wasn’t something she’d
//expect the evil Professor Quirrell to teach - or arrange to be taught, since
//Hermione couldn’t imagine he could do the spell himself.

// 6066
//“Yes,” Harry said. “Students don’t usually learn the Patronus Charm until their
//fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell says the Ministry schedules
//were made up by talking Flobberworms, and the ability to cast the Patronus
//Charm depends on emotions more than magical strength. Professor Quirrell says
//that he thinks most students do __way__ less than they can, and this year
//he’s going to prove it.”

// 6067
//There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry’s voice had when he talked
//about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her teeth and kept walking.

// 6068
//“I already signed up, actually,” Hermione said, her voice a little quiet. “I
//did it this morning. For everything, just like you said.”

// 6069
//__In for a penny, in for a pound__ was the usual expression.

// 6070
//Besides, she didn’t want to __lose__, and if she wanted to win she had to
//learn.

// 6071
//“So you __will__ be in the armies, then?” Harry’s voice was suddenly
//enthusiastic. “That’s awesome, Hermione! I’ve already gotten my list of
//soldiers, but I’m sure Professor Quirrell will let me add one more, or trade -”

// 6072
//“I’m not joining __your__ army.” Hermione’s voice was sharp. She knew it
//was a reasonable assumption but it __still__ annoyed her.

// 6073
//Harry blinked. “Not Draco Malfoy’s, surely. So you want to be in the third
//army? Even though we don’t know who the general __is__ yet?” Harry sounded
//surprised and a little wounded, and she couldn’t blame him, though of course
//she did blame him, since in fact it was all his fault. “But why not mine?”

// 6074
//“Think about it,” Hermione snapped, “and maybe you’ll work it out!”

// 6075
//And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.

// 6076
//“Professor Quirrell,” Draco said in his most formal voice, “I must protest your
//appointment of Hermione Granger as the third general.”

// 6077
//“Oh?” said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a casual and
//relaxed manner. “Protest away, Mr. Malfoy.”

// 6078
//“Granger is unfit for the position,” said Draco.

// 6079
//Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully. “Why yes, yes she
//is. Do you have any further protests?”

// 6080
//“Professor Quirrell,” said Harry Potter beside him, “with all due respect to
//Miss Granger’s many outstanding academic talents and the Quirrell points she
//has justly earned in your classes, her personality is not suited to military
//command.”

// 6081
//Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany him to Professor
//Quirrell’s office. It wasn’t __just__ that Harry was a gigantic blatant
//teacher’s pet where Professor Quirrell was concerned. Draco had also started to
//worry that Harry actually __was__ friends with Granger, it had been a
//while now and he __still__ hadn’t made his move… but this was more like
//it.

// 6082
//“I agree with Mr. Potter,” said Draco. “Appointing her as a general turns it
//into a farce.”

// 6083
//“Harshly put,” said Harry, “but I cannot bring myself to disagree with Mr.
//Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione Granger has around as much
//intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes.”

// 6084
//“That,” said Professor Quirrell mildly, “is not a thing I would fail to notice
//myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already know.”

// 6085
//It was Draco’s turn to say something, but the conversation had suddenly
//hiccupped. That answer had __not__ been in the possibilities he and Harry
//had brainstormed before coming here. What __did__ you say after the
//teacher said that he knew everything you knew and he was still going to commit
//an obvious mistake?

// 6086
//The silence stretched.

// 6087
//“Is this some sort of plot?” Harry said slowly.

// 6088
//“Must everything I do be some sort of plot?” said Professor Quirrell. “Can’t I
//ever create chaos just for the sake of chaos?”

// 6089
//Draco almost choked.

// 6090
//“Not in your Battle Magic class,” Harry said with calm certainty. “Other
//places, maybe, but not there.”

// 6091
//Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.

// 6092
//Harry gazed steadily back at him.

// 6093
//Draco shivered.

// 6094
//“Well then,” Professor Quirrell said. “Neither of you seem to have considered a
//very simple question. Who could I appoint instead of Miss Granger?”

// 6095
//“Blaise Zabini,” Draco said without hesitation.

// 6096
//“Any other suggestions?” said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite amused.

// 6097
//__Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan,__ came the thought, before
//Draco’s common sense kicked in and ruled out mudbloods and Hufflepuffs no
//matter how aggressively they dueled. So instead Draco just said, “What’s wrong
//with Zabini?”

// 6098
//“I __see__…” Harry said slowly.

// 6099
//“I __don’t,__” said Draco. “Why not Zabini?”

// 6100
//Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. “Because, Mr. Malfoy, no matter how hard he
//tries, he’ll never be able to keep up with you or Mr. Potter.”

// 6101
//The shock of it staggered Draco. “You can’t believe __Granger__ is going
//to -”

// 6102
//“He’s gambling on her,” Harry said quietly. “It’s not guaranteed. The odds
//aren’t even good. She’ll probably never give us a good fight, and even if she
//does, it may take her months to learn. But she’s the only one in our year with
//any chance at all of growing to beat us.”

// 6103
//Draco’s hands twitched but didn’t clench into fists. Showing up as your
//supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining tactic, so Harry
//Potter __was__ in it with Granger and __that __implied -

// 6104
//“But Professor,” Harry went on smoothly, “I’m worried Hermione will be
//__miserable __as the general of an army. I’m speaking as her friend now,
//Professor Quirrell. The competition might be good for Draco and me, but what
//you’re asking her to do isn’t good for __her!__”

// 6105
//Never mind.

// 6106
//“Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit,” Professor Quirrell said
//dryly. “Especially as you are able to be friends with Draco Malfoy at the same
//time. Quite a feat, that.”

// 6107
//Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt a lot
//__more __nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself. Of course Harry
//wasn’t going to fool Professor Quirrell.

// 6108
//“And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly concern,” said
//Professor Quirrell. “She asked me for the position, Mr. Potter, I did not ask
//her.”

// 6109
//Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a quick look that
//mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time, __Sorry, I did my
//best__ and __We’d better not press it any further.__

// 6110
//“As for her being miserable,” Professor Quirrell went on, a slight smile now
//playing about his lips, “I suspect that she will have a much easier time with
//the rigors of her position than either of you suspect, and that she will put up
//a good fight much sooner than you think.”

// 6111
//Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.

// 6112
//“You’re not going to __advise__ her, are you?” said Draco, utterly aghast.

// 6113
//“I never signed up to fight __you!__” said Harry.

// 6114
//The smile playing around Professor Quirrell’s lips grew wider. “As a matter of
//fact, I __did__ offer to share a few suggestions regarding Miss Granger’s
//first battles.”

// 6115
//“__Professor Quirrell!__” said Harry.

// 6116
//“Oh, don’t worry,” Professor Quirrell said. “She turned me down. Just as I
//expected.”

// 6117
//Draco’s eyes narrowed.

// 6118
//“Dear me, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “didn’t anyone ever tell you
//it’s rude to stare?”

// 6119
//“You’re not going to secretly help her some __other__ way, are you?” said
//Harry.

// 6120
//“Would I do that?” said Professor Quirrell.

// 6121
//“Yes,” said Draco and Harry at the same time.

// 6122
//“I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to help General
//Granger in any way that the two of you don’t know about. And now I suggest that
//both of you be about your military affairs. November approaches, and swiftly.”

// 6123
//Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the way behind them
//on their way out of Professor Quirrell’s office.

// 6124
//Harry had once spoken dismissively of “people stuff”.

// 6125
//And now that was Draco’s only hope.

// 6126
//Let him not realize, let him not realize…

// 6127
//“We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of our way,” said
//Draco. “After we crush her, we can have our own contest without any
//distractions.”

// 6128
//“Now that doesn’t really seem fair to her, does it?” said Harry in a mild
//voice.

// 6129
//“What do __you__ care?” said Draco. “She’s your rival, right?” Then, with
//just the right note of suspicion in his voice, “Don’t tell me you’ve started
//__really__ liking her, after being her rival all this time…”

// 6130
//“Founders forbid,” said Harry. “What can I say, Draco? I merely have a natural
//sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She has a very firm grasp on good
//and evil, and she’s probably going to attack evil first. Having a name like
//‘Malfoy’ is just asking for it, you know.”

// 6131
//__DAMN IT!__

// 6132
//“Harry,” said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little superior, “don’t you
//want to fight __fairly__ against me?”

// 6133
//“You mean rather than attacking you after you’ve already lost some of your
//forces beating Granger?” said Harry. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe after I get bored
//with just winning I’ll try that ‘fair’ thing.”

// 6134
//“Maybe she’ll attack __you,__” Draco said. ”__You’re__ her rival.”

// 6135
//“But I’m her __friendly__ rival,” Harry said with an evil grin. “I bought
//her a nice birthday present and everything. You wouldn’t go around sabotaging
//your friendly rival like that.”

// 6136
//“What about sabotaging your __friend’s__ chance at a fair fight?” said
//Draco angrily. “I thought we were friends!”

// 6137
//“Let me rephrase that,” said Harry. “__Granger__ wouldn’t sabotage a
//friendly rival. But that’s because she has the killing intention of a bowl of
//wet grapes. __You__ would. You __totally__ would. And guess what, so
//would I.”

// 6138
//__DAMN IT!__

// 6139
//If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.

// 6140
//The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and perfectly combed
//white-blonde hair, faced the villain.

// 6141
//The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her buckteeth clearly
//visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over her cheeks, faced the hero.

// 6142
//It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming up on Sunday.

// 6143
//Draco was standing in General Granger’s office, a room the size of a small
//classroom. (__Why__ each general’s office was so large, Draco wasn’t quite
//sure. A chair and a desk would have worked for him. He wasn’t even clear on why
//the generals needed offices at all, his soldiers knew where to find him. Unless
//Professor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the huge offices for them as a
//sign of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)

// 6144
//Granger sat on the room’s single chair like a throne, all the way on the other
//end of the office from where the door opened. There was a long oblong table
//stretched across the middle of the room between them, and four small circular
//tables scattered around the corners, but only that one single chair, all the
//way at the opposite end. The room had windows along one wall, and one beam of
//sunlight touched the top of Granger’s hair like a glowing crown.

// 6145
//It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly forward. But there
//was a table in the way, and Draco had to go around it diagonally, and there was
//no good way to do that in a dramatic and dignified fashion. Had that been
//deliberate? If it had been his father, it surely would have been; but this was
//Granger, so surely not.

// 6146
//There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn’t stood up, either.

// 6147
//Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.

// 6148
//“Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy,” Granger said once he stood before her, “you requested
//an audience with me and I have been so gracious as to grant it. What was your
//plea?”

// 6149
//__Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would like to show
//you some interesting spells.__

// 6150
//____

// 6151
//“Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer,” said Draco, putting a serious
//look on his face. “He doesn’t mind losing to me, but would be humiliated if you
//won. So he wants to join with me and wipe you out immediately, not just in our
//first battle, all of them. If I won’t do that, Potter wants me to hold back or
//harass you, while he launches an all-out attack on you as his first move.”

// 6152
//“I see,” Granger said, looking surprised. “And you’re offering to help me
//against him?”

// 6153
//“Of course,” said Draco smoothly. “I didn’t think what he wanted to do to you
//was fair.”

// 6154
//“Why, that’s very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy,” said Granger. “I’m sorry for how I
//spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I call you Drakey?”

// 6155
//Alarm bells started to sound in Draco’s head, but there was a __chance__
//she meant it…

// 6156
//“Of course,” said Draco, “if I can call you Hermy.”

// 6157
//Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.

// 6158
//“Anyway,” Draco said, “I was thinking it would serve Potter right if we both
//attacked him and wiped him out.”

// 6159
//“But that wouldn’t be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?” said Granger.

// 6160
//“I think it’d be very fair,” Draco said. “He was planning to do it to you
//first.”

// 6161
//Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have intimidated him if
//he’d been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. “You think I’m pretty stupid, don’t
//you, Mr. Malfoy?”

// 6162
//Draco smiled charmingly. “No, Miss Granger, but I thought I’d at least
//__check.__ So, what do you want?”

// 6163
//“Are you offering to __bribe__ me?” said Granger.

// 6164
//“Sure,” said Draco. “Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you beat on Potter
//instead of me for the rest of the year?”

// 6165
//“Nope,” said Granger, “but you can offer me ten Galleons and have me attack
//both of you equally, instead of just you.”

// 6166
//“Ten Galleons is a lot of money,” Draco said cautiously.

// 6167
//“I didn’t know the Malfoys were poor,” said Granger.

// 6168
//Draco stared at Granger.

// 6169
//He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.

// 6170
//That particular reply didn’t seem like it should have come from this particular
//girl.

// 6171
//“Well,” said Draco, “you don’t get to be rich by wasting money, you know.”

// 6172
//“I don’t know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my parents are
//__dentists__ and anything less than ten Galleons isn’t worth my time at
//all.”

// 6173
//“Three Galleons,” Draco said, more as a probe than anything else.

// 6174
//“Nope,” said Granger. “If you want an equal fight at all, I don’t believe that
//a Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants ten Galleons.”

// 6175
//Draco was starting to get a __very__ strange feeling about this.

// 6176
//“No,” said Draco.

// 6177
//“No?” said Granger. “This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy. Are you sure you
//want to risk a whole year of being miserably crushed by the Boy-Who-Lived? That
//would be pretty embarrassing for the House of Malfoy, wouldn’t it?”

// 6178
//It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse, but you didn’t
//get to be rich by spending money when your heart told you it was a setup.

// 6179
//“No,” said Draco.

// 6180
//“See you on Sunday,” said Granger.

// 6181
//Draco turned and walked out of the office without another word.

// 6182
//That had been __not right…__

// 6183
//“Hermione,” Harry said patiently, “we’re __supposed__ to be plotting
//against each other. You could even betray me and it wouldn’t mean anything
//outside the battlefield.”

// 6184
//Hermione shook her head. “It wouldn’t be nice, Harry.”

// 6185
//Harry sighed. “I don’t think you’re getting into the spirit of this at all.”

// 6186
//__It wouldn’t be nice.__ She’d actually said that. Hermione didn’t know
//whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or worried about whether
//she really __did __sound like that much of a goody-two-shoes usually.

// 6187
//It was probably time to change the subject.

// 6188
//“Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?” said Hermione. “It’s -”

// 6189
//Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.

// 6190
//“Yes, Hermione,” Harry said a little tightly, “what day is it?”

// 6191
//__Interlude:__

// 6192
//There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween in magical
//Britain.

// 6193
//Now it was Harry Potter Day.

// 6194
//Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from Minister Fudge which
//might have been good for future political favors and which he __really__
//should have gritted his teeth and taken. But to Harry, October 31st would
//always be The Dark Lord Killed My Parents Day. There should have been a quiet,
//dignified memorial service somewhere, and if there was one, he hadn’t been
//invited.

// 6195
//Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins didn’t dare wear
//black outside their own dorm. There were special events and special foods and
//the teachers looked the other way if anyone ran through the hallways. It was
//the tenth anniversary, after all.

// 6196
//Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for anyone else, eating
//snack bars in place of meals, reading some of his sadder science fiction books
//(no fantasy), and writing a letter to Mum and Dad that was much longer than the
//ones he usually sent.
