//== Self Actualization, Pt 6

// 12346
//“Well,” Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could, “at least now
//I don’t feel like the only sane person in Hogwarts any more.”

// 12347
//“Because now you’ve got the rest of us as friends?” whispered Lavender Brown,
//who was tiptoeing along at her left side.

// 12348
//“I don’t think that’s what she means,” General Granger murmured from Lavender’s
//own left.

// 12349
//They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of Hogwarts, all eight of
//them keeping both ears peeled for the slightest sound of Trouble, just like it
//was a battle and they were looking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this
//case they were looking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the
//span between the end of breakfast-time and when Lavender and Parvati had to get
//to their Herbology class.

// 12350
//Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down three older
//bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able to outfight twenty-four
//older bullies because of Multiplication.

// 12351
//Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General Granger hadn’t
//found this convincing.

// 12352
//Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument, and then
//observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up first-year girls
//probably wouldn’t be good for your reputation as a bully.

// 12353
//Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant they were the
//__only ones__ who could do something about Hogwarts’s bully problem, which
//made it __really truly__ heroinic. Plus the __whole reason__ their
//parents had moved to Britain was so that the two of them could attend the
//world’s only magical school with a 0// fatality rate, and what was the point if
//they didn’t take advantage and try a few things?

// 12354
//To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn’t understand the point
//of a perfect safety record __at all__ -

// 12355
//Lavender had said that if they were __really__ all friends together and
//not Hermione’s followers like Professor Quirrell thought, then they should vote
//on things like this.

// 12356
//Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote after Hermione and
//Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had considered it carefully after her
//first flush of enthusiasm wore off. She __was__ a Slytherin, after all,
//and that meant it was __her__ responsibility to keep a watchful eye on
//their own interests while they were all running around trying to help people -
//her job to figure out how risky it really was, and whether it would be worth it
//for __them__, just like Mother would have done in her place. Always
//looking out for yourself and your friends like that, was what real Slytherining
//was all about…

// 12357
//Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a small trembling
//voice said “Yes.”

// 12358
//And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione __had__ to stay with the other five,
//they couldn’t __possibly__ let the others go off on their own. Because no
//Gryffindor would ever live down hurting the last surviving child of the Bones
//family, and no Slytherin would dare assault a daughter of the Noble and Most
//Ancient House of Greengrass. (Daphne __hoped__ so, anyway.) And General
//Granger who’d started the whole thing… you didn’t even have to ask.

// 12359
//The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another, their tense hands
//never straying far from their wands, as stone and wood and Everburning Torches
//came into vision and then moved past. At one point they heard footsteps and
//drew in their breath, hands almost dropping to their wands, but it was just a
//lone older Ravenclaw who looked at them curiously before sniffing and dropping
//his head back to his book as he walked on.

// 12360
//The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded frescos, and
//came to a dead end leading into a boys’ bathroom, and turned around, and
//wandered __back__ through the solemn oaken panels carved with gilded
//frescos, and then turned through dusty old brick corridors grouted with worn
//cement, which sort of led them in a circle actually, so they consulted a
//portrait and then went down a __different__ dusty old brick corridor
//instead, that took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should’ve put
//them on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it’d been anywhere but Hogwarts, and
//then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and skylights that let shafts
//of sunlight pour down even though they were nowhere near the roof, and after
//they’d followed that passageway around a few corners it took them to another
//boys’ bathroom, clearly marked with a plaque showing the silhouette of a robed
//figure whizzing into a toilet.

// 12361
//The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a certain amount
//of weariness.

// 12362
//“I’m bored,” said Lavender.

// 12363
//Padma made a show of taking a pocketwatch out of her robes and looking at it.
//“Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds,” she said. “A new record for the longest
//attention span in Gryffindor.”

// 12364
//“__I__ don’t think this is going to work either,” said Susan. “And I’m a
//__Hufflepuff__.”

// 12365
//“Y’know,” Lavender said thoughtfully, “I wonder if maybe what __really__
//makes someone a hero, is that when they try something like this, something
//interesting__ actually happens__.”

// 12366
//“I bet you’re right,” said Tracey. “I bet if we had __Harry Potter__ with
//us, we’d run into three bullies and a hidden room full of treasure in the first
//five minutes. I bet that all General Chaos has to do is go to the bathroom and
//he, like, finds Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets or something -”

// 12367
//Daphne couldn’t quite let that one go past. “You think Lord Slytherin would’ve
//put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a __bathroom -__”

// 12368
//“What I’m __saying,__” said Susan, as Tracey was opening her mouth to
//reply, “is that we’ve got no way of actually __finding__ any bullies. I
//mean, all __they’ve__ got to do is find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we’ve
//got to run across them at exactly the right __time__, d’you see? Which is
//a __very good problem__ because if we __did__ find them we’d all get
//squished like bugs. Can’t we just do the forbidden third-floor corridor like
//we’re __supposed__ to?”

// 12369
//Lavender snorted scornfully. “You don’t become a __real__ heroine just by
//doing the forbidden things the Headmaster __tells__ you not to do!”

// 12370
//(Daphne’s mind tried to wrap around this statement as she silently thanked the
//Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near Gryffindor.)

// 12371
//“Come to think…” Parvati said slowly, “I mean, what’re the odds that Harry
//Potter would run across those five bullies on his __first morning__ of
//school? He must’ve had __some__ way of finding them.”

// 12372
//Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her see Hermione,
//so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl’s expression change - and then she realized
//that the Sunshine General had __also__ found some bullies just recently -

// 12373
//“Oh!” said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. “Of course! He got told by
//the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!”

// 12374
//“__What?__” said Daphne at the same time as several other people.

// 12375
//“That’s who the ghost was that scared me, I’m pretty sure,” Padma explained. “I
//mean I only figured it out afterward, but… yeah. Salazar Slytherin’s ghost
//doesn’t like it when Slytherins bully people, he thinks it shames his name, and
//the ghost is still keyed into the Hogwarts wards so he knows everything that
//happens, I bet.”

// 12376
//Daphne’s mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah had put a hand to her
//forehead and was leaning against the stone walls, while Tracey’s eyes were
//blazing like little brown stars.

// 12377
//__Salazar Slytherin’s ghost?__

// 12378
//Had leagued himself with __Harry Potter?__

// 12379
//And had sent __Hermione Granger__ to stop Derrick’s crew?

// 12380
//She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco Malfoy got told
//about this.

// 12381
//Although considering how fast rumors spread through Hogwarts, now that Padma
//had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told him thirty minutes ago…

// 12382
//In fact… now that Daphne __thought__ about it…

// 12383
//“So,” said Parvati. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to find Salazar
//Slytherin’s ghost? Wow, I guess if I’m saying stuff like that out loud, I might
//actually be turning into a heroine -”

// 12384
//“Yes!” said Lavender. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to find Salazar
//Slytherin’s ghost!”

// 12385
//“We’ve got to ask… the Boy-Who-Lived… where to find Salazar Slytherin’s ghost…”
//repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she was forcing herself to say it.

// 12386
//“And if __that__ doesn’t work,” shouted Tracey, “we’ll stun Harry Potter,
//tie him up and bring him __with__ us!”

// 12387
//It said something, Hermione Granger thought, and it was something rather sad -
//as the eight of them strolled back through the maze of twisty little passages
//that was Hogwarts, their time before the next class having run out without
//finding any bullies - that she genuinely didn’t know whether Harry Potter had
//been led around by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin or a phoenix or
//__what.__ And whatever Harry had done, she hoped it __didn’t__ work
//for them. And most of all she hoped that the others didn’t vote for Tracey’s
//idea of stunning Harry Potter and carting his unconscious body around with them
//to attract Adventures. That couldn’t possibly work in real life, or, if it did,
//she was giving up.

// 12388
//Hermione looked from witch to witch, Tracey chatting with Lavender, and the
//others making occasional remarks; and her gaze caught on a girl who was subdued
//and quiet, the one person whose thoughts right now she couldn’t guess at all.

// 12389
//“Hannah?” she said to the girl walking alongside her. Hermione tried to make
//her voice as gentle as she could. “You don’t have to answer, but is it okay if
//I ask why you voted yes on fighting bullies?”

// 12390
//Hermione had thought she’d made her voice soft, but everyone stopped walking,
//and Lavender and Tracey halted their conversation and looked at them.

// 12391
//Hannah’s cheeks were already reddening, and just as Hannah opened her mouth -

// 12392
//“It’s ‘cause she’s got more courage than __you__ think, obviously,” said
//Lavender.

// 12393
//Hannah paused with her mouth open.

// 12394
//She closed her mouth.

// 12395
//She swallowed, hard and visibly, while her cheeks reddened even further.

// 12396
//Then Hannah took a deep breath, and said, in a small voice, “There’s a boy I
//like.”

// 12397
//The Hufflepuff girl flinched as she said it, and her head darted around
//nervously to look at everyone looking at her, while the pause and silence
//stretched.

// 12398
//“Um, okay?” Susan said eventually.

// 12399
//“I’ve got __five__ boys I like,” said Lavender.

// 12400
//“Padma and I knew we’d both like the same boys,” said Parvati, “so we made a
//list and flipped a Knut to see who got to pick first.”

// 12401
//“I know who __I’m__ destined to marry,” said Tracey. “I don’t care what
//the world says, he’s meant to be mine!”

// 12402
//This made all the other girls look expectantly at Hermione, whose brain had
//gone ahead and flushed Tracey’s last statement entirely so it could focus on
//just on the first thing Hannah had said.

// 12403
//“Um,” said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping her voice gentle. “Hannah,
//the reason why you joined the Society for Promotion of Heroic Equality for
//Witches was that there’s a boy who might like you more if you become a hero?”

// 12404
//The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, her cheeks reddening even further while she
//stared down at her own reflection in her black-polished shoes.

// 12405
//“She likes Neville Longbottom, actually,” Daphne said. The Slytherin gave a
//woeful sigh. “And unfortunately for her, he’s going to marry someone else. It’s
//very tragic.”

// 12406
//This produced a high-pitched __eeping__ sound from Hannah as she went on
//staring at her feet.

// 12407
//“Wait what?” said Lavender. “Neville’s going to marry someone else? How do you
//know about this? __Who?__”

// 12408
//Daphne just shook her head sadly with a downcast expression.

// 12409
//“__Excuse me__,” said Hermione, and then when the others looked at her
//again, “Ah…” while she tried to organize her thoughts. “I mean, um… Hannah…
//trying to become a hero so that a boy will like you isn’t very
//__feminist__.”

// 12410
//“It’s pronounced __feminine__ actually,” said Padma.

// 12411
//“And why’re you calling Hannah unfeminine?” said Susan. “There’s nothing
//unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy.”

// 12412
//“Besides,” said Parvati, sounding puzzled, “isn’t the whole point that we’re
//trying to be heroes even though that isn’t feminine?”

// 12413
//The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by Hermione Granger as one of
//her most successful forays into the realms of political education. She tried to
//explain, and then after the resulting argument tried to explain again, while
//the other seven girls looked at her more and more skeptically. Afterward Daphne
//declared in the imperious tones of the future Lady Greengrass that if this
//feminism business meant girls weren’t allowed to pursue boys in whichever way
//they pleased, then feminism could stay in the Muggle lands where it belonged.
//Lavender suggested that maybe witchism could say that witches got to do
//anything they wanted, which sounded like more fun than feminism. And finally
//Padma closed off further discussion by observing wearily that she didn’t see
//much point to going on arguing, since S.P.H.E.W. wasn’t__ about__ anything
//to do with feminism in the first place, it was just about more girls becoming
//heroes.

// 12414
//Hermione had given up at that point.

// 12415
//As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year Ravenclaws began
//shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already wincing to herself. They’d
//made it to class just barely before the opening gong, they’d had to run right
//over to their desks and sit down, so there hadn’t been time for the awful thing
//to happen __yet;__ but that just meant that Hermione got to look forward
//to the coming disaster for the __whole class.__

// 12416
//Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and everyone rose
//from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her; and for her own part
//Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin pouch and very quickly walked over
//to the door and threw it open and headed into the corridors, and of course
//Harry followed her with a surprised look because they had a library session
//scheduled -

// 12417
//“Hermione?” Harry said as he closed the door behind him. “What’s wrong?”

// 12418
//The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it, almost hitting
//Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil stepped out of the
//classroom with a dreadful look of determination upon her face.

// 12419
//“Excuse me, Mr. Potter,” came the awful words, the young girl’s high voice
//resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of doom, “can I ask you
//for help with something?”

// 12420
//Harry’s eyebrows drew up, and he said, “You can __ask,__ of course.”

// 12421
//“Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin’s ghost? We want him to tell
//us where to find bullies, like he tells you.”

// 12422
//There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the classroom.

// 12423
//The door opened again, and Su peered out with an inquiring look -

// 12424
//“Well, we’ve got to get to the library,” Harry said quite casually, his face
//looking relaxed, “would you mind following us?” and began to walk off in the
//direction that led to the library on odd-numbered days of the month, and Su
//made like she was going to follow but Harry’s face turned toward her for a
//moment.

// 12425
//It wasn’t until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his wand, said in a low
//precise voice “__Quietus__” and then turned to Padma and said, “An
//interesting guess, Miss Patil.”

// 12426
//Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, “I __should’ve__ figured it out
//earlier, really. There was that __hiss__ in the ghost’s voice, I should’ve
//thought Parselmouth right away, even before he started talking about Godric
//Gryffindor.”

// 12427
//Harry’s face didn’t change. “May I ask, Miss Patil, whether you’ve shared this
//thought with -”

// 12428
//“She said it in front of everyone in S.P.H.E.W.,” Hermione said.

// 12429
//Harry’s eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly calculating
//something, and then he said, “Hermione, what’s the chance that -”

// 12430
//“She said it in front of Lavender __and__ Tracey.”

// 12431
//“Um,” said Padma. “Should I not’ve done that?”

// 12432
//“Wait here,” growled Mr. Goyle, and went around the corner; and there was the
//sound of him knocking on Draco Malfoy’s private room.

// 12433
//There was a bit of a queasy feeling in Tracey’s stomach, and she reminded
//herself again that since Padma had spilled the beans __someone__ was bound
//to tell Draco Malfoy, and it might as well be __her__, and it wasn’t as if
//she __owed__ Harry Potter anything, and a Slytherin had to do what was
//necessary to achieve her Ambitions.

// 12434
//She’d been collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell told her off, and
//so far she’d decided that she wanted to own her own Nimbus 2000 broomstick,
//become super famous, marry Harry Potter, eat Chocolate Frogs for breakfast
//every day, and defeat at least __three__ Dark Lords just to show Professor
//Quirrell who was ordinary.

// 12435
//“Mr. Malfoy will see you,” said the low, menacing voice of Mr. Goyle as he
//returned. “And you’d better hope he doesn’t think you’re wasting his time.” The
//boy loomed at her briefly, and then stepped aside.

// 12436
//Tracey added having her own servants to her list of Ambitions, and entered.

// 12437
//The Malfoy private bedroom looked just like Daphne’s. She’d been privately
//hoping for diamond chandeliers or golden frescos on the walls - she’d never
//have said it in front of Daphne, but the House of Malfoy __was__ a step up
//from Greengrass. But it was just a small bedroom like Daphne’s, and the only
//difference was that Malfoy’s stuff was decorated in silver snakes instead of
//emerald plants.

// 12438
//As she stepped through the doorway, Draco Malfoy - who was perfectly groomed
//even inside his own bedroom - rose up from his desk chair to greet her with a
//small friendly bow, wearing a charming smile just like she was someone who
//__mattered,__ which made Tracey so flustered that she forgot everything
//she’d rehearsed inside her head and just blurted out, “I’ve got something to
//tell you!”

// 12439
//“Yes, Gregory said so,” Draco Malfoy said smoothly. “Please, Miss Davis, sit
//down.” He gestured to __his own desk chair__, even as he sat down on his
//bed.

// 12440
//She felt somewhat lightheaded as she carefully sat herself down in Malfoy’s own
//chair, her fingers unthinkingly fiddling with how her dress robes fell across
//her knees, trying to make them look as elegant and uncreased as Draco Malfoy’s
//-

// 12441
//“So, Miss Davis,” said Draco Malfoy. “What did you want to tell me?”

// 12442
//Tracey hesitated, and then when Malfoy’s face started to look a bit impatient,
//just stammered it all out, everything Padma had said about Salazar Slytherin’s
//ghost sending Harry Potter to stop bullies and also what Daphne had told her
//about Hermione Granger being in on it -

// 12443
//Draco Malfoy’s expression didn’t change at all as she spoke, not even in the
//slightest, and it dawned on Tracey with a sickening lurch in her stomach.

// 12444
//“You don’t __believe__ me!” she said.

// 12445
//There was a slight pause.

// 12446
//“Well,” said Draco Malfoy, with a smile that wasn’t quite as charming as his
//last one, “I __do__ believe that’s what Padma said and what Daphne said,
//so thank you anyway, Miss Davis.” The boy rose from where he’d been sitting on
//his bed, and Tracey, not even thinking, rose from the chair.

// 12447
//As he was escorting her to the door, just as he was about to turn the knob, it
//occurred to Tracey that - “You didn’t ask what I wanted for the information,”
//she said.

// 12448
//Draco Malfoy gave her some kind of look, she didn’t quite know what it was
//supposed to mean, and he didn’t say anything.

// 12449
//“Well, anyway,” Tracey said, making an on-the-spot change to her previous
//Plans, “I __don’t__ want anything for the information, I was just being
//friendly.”

// 12450
//A brief look of surprise crossed Draco Malfoy’s face for just an instant before
//his expression flattened again and he said, “It’s not that easy to become
//friends with a Malfoy, Miss Davis.”

// 12451
//Tracey smiled, and meant it. “Well, I’ll just go on being friendly, then,” she
//said, and left the room with a skip in her step, feeling like a real Slytherin
//for maybe the first time in her life, and having just decided that Draco Malfoy
//would be one of her husbands too.

// 12452
//After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again and said, “Are
//you alright, Mr. Malfoy?”

// 12453
//Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off into nowhere,
//like he was trying to stare through the wall of his bedroom, through the
//Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin dungeons, through Earth’s crust and
//atmosphere and the interstellar dust of the Milky Way, into the utterly empty
//and lightless void between galaxies which no wizard and no scientist had ever
//seen.

// 12454
//“Mr. Malfoy?” Gregory said, starting to sound a little worried.

// 12455
//“I can’t believe I believed every word of that,” said Draco.

// 12456
//Daphne finished her final inch of Transfiguration and looked up across the
//Slytherin common room, at where Millicent Bulstrode was still working on her
//own homework. It was time to come to a Decision.

// 12457
//If S.P.H.E.W. did go around trying to stun bullies, the bullies wouldn’t like
//it, that was certain. And they’d try to do something unpleasant about it, which
//was also certain. On the other hand, if the bullies got really nasty then
//Hermione could ask Harry Potter for help, or they could pool their combined
//Quirrell points and ask the Defense Professor for a favor… No, the thing that
//Daphne was __really__ worried about was if this business got them in bad
//with Professor Snape. You didn’t want to __ever__ end up on the wrong side
//of Professor Snape.

// 12458
//But since the day she’d challenged Neville to a Most Ancient Duel, she’d
//noticed people looking at her differently. Even the Slytherins who’d made fun
//of her were looking at her differently. It was dawning on Daphne that being the
//daughter of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass brought in a
//__lot__ more respect if you were a beautiful __heroine__ born to a
//Most Ancient House, and not just a pretty noble girl. It was the difference
//between having your role played by the lead actress and having your role played
//by a two-Galleon extra with a screechy laugh.

// 12459
//Fighting bullies might not be the __best__ way to become a heroine. But
//Father had once told her that the trouble with passing up opportunities was
//that it was habit-forming. If you told yourself you were waiting for a better
//opportunity next time, why, next time you’d probably tell yourself the same
//thing. Father had said that most people spent their whole __lives__
//waiting for an opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had
//said that while seizing opportunities __would__ mean that all sorts of
//things went wrong, it wasn’t nearly as bad as being a hopeless lump. Father had
//said that __after__ she got into the habit of seizing opportunities,
//__then__ it was time to start being picky about them.

// 12460
//On the other hand, Mother had warned her not to take all of Father’s advice,
//and said that Daphne wasn’t allowed to ask about Father’s sixth year in
//Hogwarts until she was at least thirty years old.

// 12461
//But in the end Father __had__ gotten Mother to marry him and successfully
//plotted his way into a Most Ancient House, so there __was__ that.

// 12462
//Millicent Bulstrode finished her homework and began putting her things away.

// 12463
//Daphne stood up from her desk, and walked over.

// 12464
//Millicent swung out her legs from the table and stood up, slinging her bookbag
//over one shoulder, then looked over at where Daphne was approaching, the girl’s
//expression puzzled.

// 12465
//“Hey, Millicent,” Daphne said as she drew near, making her voice low and
//excited, “guess what I figured out today?”

// 12466
//“The thing about Salazar Slytherin’s ghost helping Granger?” said Millicent. “I
//already heard about that -”

// 12467
//“No,” Daphne said in a hushed whisper, “this is even __better.__”

// 12468
//“Really?” Millicent said, in an equally low excited voice. “What is it?”

// 12469
//Daphne looked around conspiratorially. “Come to my room and I’ll tell you.”

// 12470
//They went off toward the stairs that led downward, the private rooms were even
//lower in the lake than the seventh-year dorms…

// 12471
//Soon enough Daphne was sitting in her comfy desk-chair and Millicent had
//bounced over to the edge of her bed.

// 12472
//“__Quietus,__” said Daphne, when they were both seated; and then instead
//of putting her wand away inside her robes, Daphne just let her hand fall
//naturally down to her side, still holding the wand, just in case.

// 12473
//“All __right!__” said Millicent. “What __is__ it?”

// 12474
//“You know what I figured out?” said Daphne. “I figured out that you get the
//gossip __so__ fast, you know about things __before they actually
//happen__.”

// 12475
//Daphne had half-expected Millicent to turn white and fall over, and she didn’t
//really, but the girl did flinch pretty hard before she started stammering
//denials.

// 12476
//“Don’t worry,” said Daphne with her sweetest smile, “I won’t tell anyone else
//you’re a seer. I mean, we’re friends, right?”

// 12477
//Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working diligently on yet
//another two-foot essay (she was taking everything except Divination and Muggle
//Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed to consist __entirely__ of homework)
//when her Head of House strode up to the table she was working at and barked
//“You will come with me, Miss Felthorne!” and walked away even as she
//frantically began putting away her parchment and book and quill.

// 12478
//When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just outside the room
//and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that seemed far too intense; and before
//she could ask what this was about he spun without a word and stalked off
//through the hallways, so that she had to scramble to keep up.

//Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another, below what
//she’d thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin dungeons. And the corridors
//began to look older in their appearance, the architecture reverting back in
//time by centuries into roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar.
//She began to wonder if Professor Snape was taking her to the __real__
//dungeons that she’d heard rumors of, the true dungeons of Hogwarts that had
//been sealed off to all but faculty; and if maybe Professor Snape did terrible
//things down there to innocent helpless young girls but that was probably just
//wishful thinking on her part.

//They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a room that was no
//room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a single door, pierced by many dark
//openings and lit by a single torch of ancient style that fired as they entered.

// 12481
//Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charm after Charm,
//she lost track of how many; and when the Potions Master was done he turned back
//toward her, locked his intense eyes on hers, and said in a level voice unlike
//his usual drawl, “You will say nothing to anyone of this matter, Miss
//Felthorne, nothing now or ever. If that is acceptable to you, nod. If not, we
//will turn and go.”

// 12482
//She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her heart (well, not
//exactly her heart).

// 12483
//“The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne,” said Professor
//Snape’s toneless voice, “and your extremely generous pay of fifty Galleons is
//merely to compensate you for being Memory-Charmed afterward.”

// 12484
//She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but they had other
//daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was certainly a lot of money for
//__her__.

// 12485
//Then her ears caught up with the words __Memory-Charmed__ and for a moment
//she felt outraged, there was no point if she couldn’t keep the memories, what
//sort of girl did Professor Snape think she __was?__

// 12486
//“You surely know,” said Severus Snape, “of Miss Hermione Granger, the Sunshine
//General?”

// 12487
//“__What?__” said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and disgust. “She’s in
//her __first year!__ __Ew!__”
