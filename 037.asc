// 7282
//== Interlude: Crossing the Boundary

// 7283
//It was almost midnight.

// 7284
//Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn’t used the
//Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep cycle to make sure
//he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into Christmas Day; because while
//he’d never been young enough to __believe__ in Santa Claus, he’d once been
//young enough to doubt.

// 7285
//It would have been nice if there __had__ been a mysterious figure who
//entered your house in the night and brought you presents…

// 7286
//A chill went down Harry’s spine then.

// 7287
//An intimation of something dreadful approaching.

// 7288
//A creeping terror.

// 7289
//A sense of doom.

// 7290
//Harry sat bolt upright in bed.

// 7291
//He looked at the window.

// 7292
//“__Professor Quirrell?__” Harry shrieked very quietly.

// 7293
//Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry’s window seemed to
//fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter blew into the room through
//the gap, along with a scant few flakes of snow from a sky spotted with grey
//night-clouds, amid the black and stars.

// 7294
//“Fear not, Mr. Potter,” said the Defense Professor in a normal voice. “I have
//Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake until I have departed.”

// 7295
//“No one’s supposed to know where I am!” said Harry, still keeping the shriek
//quiet. “Even owls are supposed to deliver my mail to Hogwarts, not here!” Harry
//had agreed to that willingly; it would be silly if a Death Eater could win the
//whole war at any time just by owling him a magically triggered hand grenade.

// 7296
//Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the backyard beyond the
//window. “Oh, I shouldn’t worry, Mr. Potter. You __are __well protected
//against locating Charms, and no blood purist is likely to think of consulting a
//phone book.” His grin grew wider. “And it did take considerable effort to cross
//the wards that the Headmaster put around this house - though of course anyone
//who knew your address could simply wait outside and attack you the next time
//you left.”

// 7297
//Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. “What are you __doing__
//here?” Harry said finally.

// 7298
//The smile left Professor Quirrell’s face. “I’ve come to apologize, Mr. Potter,”
//the Defense Professor said quietly. “I should not have spoken to you so harshly
//as I -”

// 7299
//“Don’t,” Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was clutching around
//his pajamas. “Just don’t.”

// 7300
//“Have I offended you that much?” said Professor Quirrell’s quiet voice.

// 7301
//“No,” Harry said. “But you __will__ if you apologize.”

// 7302
//“I see,” said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice grew stern. “Then
//if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr. Potter, I should say that you have
//gravely violated the etiquette that holds between friendly Slytherins. If you
//are not currently playing the game against someone, you __must__ not
//meddle in their plans like that, not without asking them __before__. For
//you do not know what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose.
//It would mark you as their enemy, Mr. Potter.”

// 7303
//“I’m sorry,” Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that Professor Quirrell
//had used.

// 7304
//“Apology accepted,” said Professor Quirrell.

// 7305
//“But,” Harry said, still quietly, “you and I really must speak further on
//politics, at some point.”

// 7306
//Professor Quirrell sighed. “I know you dislike condescension, Mr. Potter -”

// 7307
//That was a bit of an understatement.

// 7308
//“But it would be even more condescending,” said Professor Quirrell, “if I were
//not to state it clearly. You are missing some life experience, Mr. Potter.”

// 7309
//“And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with you, then?”
//said Harry calmly.

// 7310
//“What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?” said Professor
//Quirrell, and shrugged. “I think you will change your mind in time, after every
//trust you place has failed you, and you have become cynical.”

// 7311
//The Defense Professor said it as though it were the most ordinary statement in
//the world, framed against the black and the stars and the cloud-spotted sky, as
//one or two tiny snowflakes blew past him in the biting winter air.

// 7312
//“That reminds me,” said Harry. “Merry Christmas.”

// 7313
//“I suppose,” said Professor Quirrell. “After all, if it is __not__ an
//apology, then it must be a Christmas gift. The very first one I have ever
//given, in fact.”

// 7314
//Harry hadn’t even started yet on learning Latin so he could read the
//experimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his mouth to ask.

// 7315
//“Put on your winter coat,” said Professor Quirrell, “or take a warming potion
//if you have one; and meet me outside, under the stars. I shall see if I can
//maintain it a little longer this time.”

// 7316
//It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was dashing for the
//coat closet.

// 7317
//Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more than an hour,
//though the Defense Professor’s face grew strained, and he had to sit down after
//a while. Harry protested only once, and was shushed.

// 7318
//They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day within that
//timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing, the one true everlasting
//Silent Night.

// 7319
//And just as promised, Harry’s parents slept soundly all through it, until Harry
//was safely back in his room, and the Defense Professor had gone.
