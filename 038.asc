//== The Cardinal Sin

// 7321
//Bright the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright their parents,
//clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter Sun hanging low in the sky
//at 9:45AM in the morning on January 5th, 1992. Some of the younger students
//wore scarves and mittens, but most simply wore their robes; they were wizards,
//after all.

// 7322
//After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took off his scarf and
//coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and stowed away his winter things.

// 7323
//For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite at him, just to
//see what it was like.

// 7324
//Harry took out his wizards’ robes, shrugged them on.

// 7325
//And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn’t help thinking of the parents
//he’d only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose problems he was leaving
//behind…

// 7326
//With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said,
//“__Thermos.__”

// 7327
//The warmth flowed through him.

// 7328
//And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.

// 7329
//Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything else at the
//conclusion of his vacation. He didn’t feel like reading his textbooks, or even
//any serious science fiction, this morning; what he needed was something
//completely frivolous to occupy his attention…

// 7330
//Well, that wouldn’t be hard to come by, if he was willing to part with four
//Knuts.

// 7331
//Besides, if the __Daily Prophet__ was corrupt and the __Quibbler__
//was the only competing newspaper, there might be some suppressed real news in
//there.

// 7332
//Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time, wondering if the
//__Quibbler__ could top the headline he’d seen before.

// 7333
//The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the man’s face
//suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.

// 7334
//“__Harry Potter?__” gasped the vendor.

// 7335
//“No, Mr. Durian,” said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man’s nametag, “just
//an amazing imitation -”

// 7336
//And then Harry’s voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight of the top
//fold of the __Quibbler.__

// 7337
//__SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:__

// 7338
//__DARK LORD TO RETURN,__

// 7339
//For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face, before realizing
//that __not__ being shocked could be just as revealing, in a sense -

// 7340
//“Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and he didn’t even
//know whether that was too revealing, or just what his normal reaction
//__would__ be if he didn’t know anything. He’d spent too much time around
//Slytherins, he was forgetting how to keep secrets from ordinary people. Four
//Knuts hit the counter. “One copy of the __Quibbler,__ please.”

// 7341
//“Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!” said the vendor hastily, waving his hands. “It’s
//- never mind, just -”

// 7342
//A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry’s fingers, and he unfolded it.

// 7343
//__SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:__

// 7344
//__DARK LORD TO RETURN,__

// 7345
//__WED DRACO MALFOY__

// 7346
//“It’s free,” said the vendor, “for __you__, I mean -”

// 7347
//“No,” Harry said, “I was going to buy one anyway.”

// 7348
//The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.

// 7349
//“Gosh,” Harry said half a minute later, “you get a seer smashed on six slugs of
//Scotch and she spills all __sorts__ of secret stuff. I mean, who’d have
//thought that Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were secretly the same person?”

// 7350
//“Not me,” said the vendor.

// 7351
//“They’ve even got a picture of the two of them together, so we know who it is
//that’s secretly the same person.”

// 7352
//“Yup,” said the vendor. “Pretty clever disguise, innit?”

// 7353
//“And I’m secretly sixty-five years old.”

// 7354
//“You don’t look half that,” the vendor said amiably.

// 7355
//“And I’m betrothed to Hermione Granger, __and__ Bellatrix Black,
//__and__ Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy too…”

// 7356
//“Goin’ ter be one interesting wedding,” said the vendor.

// 7357
//Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant voice, “You know, I
//heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane, and I wondered if she really was,
//or if she was just making stuff up and giggling to herself the whole time. Then
//when I read my second __Quibbler__ headline, I decided that she
//__couldn’t__ be insane, I mean, it can’t be __easy__ to make this
//stuff up, you couldn’t do it by __accident__. And __now__ do you know
//what I think? I think she must be mad after all. When ordinary people try to
//make stuff up, it doesn’t come out like __this__. Something’s got to go
//really __wrong__ with the inside of your head before __this__ is what
//comes out when you start making stuff up!”

// 7358
//The vendor stared at Harry.

// 7359
//“Seriously,” said Harry. “Who __reads__ this stuff?”

// 7360
//“You,” said the vendor.

// 7361
//Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.

// 7362
//He didn’t sit at the same nearby table he’d sat down at with Draco, the
//__first__ time he’d prepared to board this train. That seemed like
//tempting history to repeat itself.

// 7363
//It wasn’t __just__ that his first week at Hogwarts had been, judging by
//the __Quibbler__, fifty-four years long. It was that, in Harry’s humble
//opinion, his life did not __need__ any new threads of complexity.

// 7364
//So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from the main crowd
//and the occasional muffled cracks of parents Apparating in with their children,
//and sat down and read the __Quibbler__ to see if it contained any
//suppressed news.

// 7365
//And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any of __that__
//was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic gossip; but nothing that
//would really be all that __important__ if it was true.

// 7366
//Harry was just reading about the Ministry’s proposed marriage law, to ban all
//marriages, when -

// 7367
//“Harry Potter,” said a silken voice that sent a shock of adrenaline jolting
//through Harry’s blood.

// 7368
//Harry looked up.

// 7369
//“Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was going to do the
//smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of King’s Cross until 10:55am.

// 7370
//Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hair drifting over
//his shoulders. The man was still carrying that same cane, lacquered in black
//with a silver snake’s head for its handle; and something about his grip
//silently said __this is a weapon of deadly power,__ not __I am
//feeble and leaning on this.__ His face was expressionless.

// 7371
//Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wands already
//gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved like a single organism with
//four legs and four arms, the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he
//could guess which was which, but then it didn’t really matter. They were merely
//Lucius’s appendages, as certainly as if they’d been the two rightmost toes on
//his left foot.

// 7372
//“I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter,” said the smooth, silken voice.
//“But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, might be my only
//opportunity to meet you.”

// 7373
//“I have received none of your owls,” Harry said calmly. “Dumbledore intercepted
//them, I presume. But I would not have answered them if I had, except through
//Draco. For me to deal with you directly, without Draco’s knowledge, would
//trespass on our friendship.”

// 7374
//__Please go away, please go away…__

// 7375
//The grey eyes glittered at him. “Is that your pose, then…” said the senior
//Malfoy. “Well. I shall play along a little. What was your purpose in
//maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a public alliance with that girl?”

// 7376
//“Oh,” Harry said lightly, “that’s obvious, right? Draco’s working with Granger
//will make him realize that Muggleborns are human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha.”

// 7377
//A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius’s lips. “Yes, that does sound like
//one of Dumbledore’s plans. Which it is __not__.”

// 7378
//“Indeed,” said Harry. “It is part of my game with Draco, and no work of
//Dumbledore’s, and that is all I will say.”

// 7379
//“Let us dispense with games,” said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly
//hardening. “If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore’s bidding
//in any case, __Mr. Potter.__”

// 7380
//There was a slight pause.

// 7381
//“So you know,” Harry said, his voice cold. “Tell me. At which point, exactly,
//did you realize?”

// 7382
//“When I read your response to Professor Quirrell’s little speech,” said the
//white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. “I was puzzled, at first, for it seemed
//not in your own interest; it took me days to understand whose interest was
//being served, and then it all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that
//you are weak, in some ways if not others.”

// 7383
//“Very clever of you,” said Harry, still cold. “But perhaps you mistake my
//interests.”

// 7384
//“Perhaps I do.” A hint of steel came into the silken voice. “Indeed, that is
//precisely what I fear. You are playing strange games with my son, to a purpose
//I cannot guess. That is not a friendly act, and you cannot but __expect__
//me to be concerned!”

// 7385
//Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both those hands
//white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.

// 7386
//Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad idea to show his
//fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated. They were in a public
//train station anyway -

// 7387
//“I find it interesting,” Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, “that
//you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius.
//__He__ is my friend, and I do not betray my friends.”

// 7388
//“__What?__” whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.

// 7389
//Then -

// 7390
//“Company,” said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the voice, that it
//must be the senior Crabbe.

// 7391
//Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of disapproval.

// 7392
//Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow behind a tall
//woman who didn’t look scared at all.

// 7393
//“Madam Longbottom,” Lucius said icily.

// 7394
//“Mr. Malfoy,” returned the woman with equal ice. “Are you being an annoyance to
//our Harry Potter?”

// 7395
//The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely bitter. “Oh, I
//rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have you?” The white-haired head
//shifted toward Neville. “And this would be Mr. Potter’s loyal lieutenant, the
//last scion of Longbottom, Neville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the
//world turn. Sometimes I think it must all be mad.”

// 7396
//Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked confused, and
//frightened.

// 7397
//“I doubt it is the world that is mad,” said Madam Longbottom. Her voice took on
//a gloating tone. “You seem in a poor mood, Mr. Malfoy. Did the speech of our
//dear Professor Quirrell cost you a few allies?”

// 7398
//“It was a clever enough slander of my abilities,” Lucius said coldly, “though
//only effective upon the fools who believe that I was truly a Death Eater.”

// 7399
//“__What?__” blurted Neville.

// 7400
//“I was under the __Imperius,__ young man,” said Lucius, now sounding
//tired. “The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting among pureblood
//families without the support of House Malfoy. I demurred, and he simply made
//sure of me. His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the
//false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.
//Some of the Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and
//for the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them controlled.
//But I was not such a fool as to support that ill-fated adventurer of my own
//choice -”

// 7401
//“Ignore him,” Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed to Harry as well
//as Neville. “He must spend the rest of his life pretending, for fear of your
//testimony under Veritaserum.” Said with malicious satisfaction.

// 7402
//Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again. “Will you
//request this harridan to depart, __Mr. Potter?__”

// 7403
//“I think not,” said Harry in a dry voice. “I prefer to deal with the part of
//House Malfoy that’s my own age.”

// 7404
//There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.

// 7405
//“Of course…” said Lucius slowly. “I __do__ feel the fool now. This whole
//time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about.”

// 7406
//Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.

// 7407
//Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on the ground.

// 7408
//The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there was nothing in
//the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snake-headed cane.

// 7409
//“My son is my heart,” said the senior Malfoy, “the last worthwhile thing I have
//left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship: if he were
//to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son
//does __not__ come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
//And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of you.”

// 7410
//Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbottom being blocked
//from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wand was in her hand, now.

// 7411
//“How __dare__ you!” she hissed.

// 7412
//Lucius’s dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as he turned to the
//senior Goyle. “We return to Malfoy Manor.”

// 7413
//There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.

// 7414
//A silence followed.

// 7415
//“Dear __heavens__,” said Madam Longbottom. “What was that about?”

// 7416
//Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.

// 7417
//There was sweat on Neville’s forehead.

// 7418
//“Thank you very much, Neville,” said Harry. “Your help was greatly appreciated,
//Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should sit down.”

// 7419
//“Yes, General,” said Neville, and instead of coming over to one of the other
//chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting position on the pavement.

// 7420
//“You have wrought many changes in my grandson,” said Madam Longbottom. “I
//approve of some, but not others.”

// 7421
//“Send me the list of which is which,” said Harry. “I’ll see what I can do.”

// 7422
//Neville groaned, but said nothing.

// 7423
//Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. “I shall, young man, thank you.” Her voice
//lowered. “Mr. Potter… the speech given by Professor Quirrell is something our
//nation has long needed to hear. I cannot say as much of your comment on it.”

// 7424
//“I will take your opinion under advisement,” Harry said mildly.

// 7425
//“I dearly hope that you do,” said Madam Longbottom, and turned back to her
//grandson. “Do I still need to -”

// 7426
//“It’s okay for you to go, Granma,” said Neville. “I’ll be fine on my own, this
//time.”

// 7427
//“Now __that__ I approve of,” she said, and popped and vanished like a soap
//bubble.

// 7428
//The two boys sat quietly for a moment.

// 7429
//Neville spoke first, his voice weary. “You’re going to try to fix all the
//changes she __approves__ of, right?”

// 7430
//“Not __all__ of them,” Harry said innocently. “I just want to make sure
//I’m not corrupting you.”

// 7431
//Draco looked __very__ worried. His head kept darting around, despite the
//fact that Draco had insisted on them going down into Harry’s trunk, and using a
//true Quieting Charm and not just the sound-blurring barrier.

// 7432
//“__What__ did you say to Father?” blurted Draco, the moment the Quieting
//Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4 vanished.

// 7433
//“I… look, can you tell me what he said to __you,__ before he dropped you
//off?” said Harry.

// 7434
//“That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be threatening me,” said
//Draco. “That I should tell him right away if there was anything __I__ was
//doing that could pose a threat to __you!__ Father thinks you’re
//__dangerous,__ Harry, whatever you said to him today it __scared__
//him! __It’s not a good idea to scare Father!__”

// 7435
//__Oh, hell…__

// 7436
//“__What__ did you talk about?” demanded Draco.

// 7437
//Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at the bottom of
//his trunk’s cavern. “You know, Draco, just as the fundamental question of
//rationality is ‘What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?’, there’s
//also a cardinal sin, a way of thinking that’s the opposite of that. Like the
//ancient Greek philosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they’d go
//around saying things like ‘All is water’ or ‘All is fire’, and they never asked
//themselves, ‘Wait a minute, even if everything __is__ water, how could I
//possibly __know__ that?’ They didn’t ask themselves if they had evidence
//which discriminated __that__ possibility from all the __other__
//possibilities you could imagine, evidence they’d be very unlikely to encounter
//if the theory __wasn’t__ true -”

// 7438
//“__Harry__,” Draco said, his voice strained, “__What did you talk
//about with Father?__”

// 7439
//“I don’t know, actually,” said Harry, “so it’s very important that I
//__not__ just make stuff up -”

// 7440
//Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high a pitch before.
