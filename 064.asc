//LORD OF THE RATIONALITY

// 11429
//Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the
//Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on
//him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long
//foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming
//longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo’s side in Rivendell filled all his
//heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as
//if some other will was using his small voice.

// 11430
//“We cannot,” said Frodo. “We must not. Do you not see? It is exactly what the
//Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen.”

// 11431
//The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the Elves; sternness in
//the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of Elrond and of Gandalf that Frodo
//almost could not withstand it. It was very hard, then, not to grasp the Ring in
//his hand, and harder still not to put it on, to face them as only Frodo.

// 11432
//“Do you not question it?” Frodo said, thin like the wind his voice, and
//wavering like a breeze. “You have chosen, of all things, to send the Ring into
//Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it come to this? That we might, of all
//our choices, do that single thing our Enemy most desires? Perhaps the Cracks of
//Doom are already guarded, strongly enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and
//Glorfindel all together; or perhaps the Master of that place has cooled the
//lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he may simply bring it out after it
//is thrown in…” A memory of awful clarity came over Frodo then, and a flash of
//black laughter, and the thought came to him that it was __just__ what the
//Enemy would do. Only the thought came to him so: __thus it would amuse me
//to do, if I meant to rule…__

// 11433
//There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Glﾃｳin and Gimli and
//Boromir were now looking at the Elves more skeptically than before, like they
//had awoken out of a dream of words.

// 11434
//“The Enemy is very wise,” said Gandalf, “and weighs all things to a nicety in
//the scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire
//for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not
//enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it
//-”

// 11435
//“He __will__ think of it!” cried Frodo. He struggled for words, trying to
//convey things that had once seemed perfect in his comprehension, and then faded
//like melting snow. “If the Enemy thought that all his foes were moved by desire
//for power alone - he would guess wrongly, over and over, and the Maker of this
//Ring would __see__ that, he would __know__ that somewhere he had made
//a mistake!” Frodo’s hands stretched forth pleadingly.

// 11436
//Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful. “You speak fair of the Enemy,”
//said Boromir, “for one of his foes.”

// 11437
//Frodo’s mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for Frodo knew, he
//knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing to say.

// 11438
//Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole room, even Elrond
//who had been about to speak. “Frodo is right, I fear,” whispered the old
//hobbit. “I remember, I remember what it was like. To see with the Black Sight.
//I remember. The Enemy will think that we might not trust one another, that the
//weaker among us will propose to destroy the Ring so that the stronger may not
//have it. He knows that even one not truly good might still cry to destroy the
//Ring, to make a show of pretended goodness. And the Enemy will __not__
//think it impossible that such a decision be made by this council, for you see,
//he does not trust us to be wise.” A whispering chuckle rose from the ancient
//hobbit’s throat. “And if he did - why, he would __still__ guard the Cracks
//of Doom. It would cost him little.”

// 11439
//Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise; Elrond had
//frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.

// 11440
//Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a despair; and as
//his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a darkness and a wavering.
//From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf, and the wizard’s strength was
//revealed as weakness, and his wisdom folly. For Frodo knew, as the Ring seemed
//to drag and weigh on his breast, that Gandalf had not thought at all of history
//and lore, when the wizard spoke of how the Enemy would not understand any
//desire save power; that Gandalf had not remembered how Sauron had cast down and
//corrupted the Men of Nﾃｺmenor in the days of their glory. Just as it had not
//occurred to Gandalf that the Enemy might learn to comprehend foes of goodwill
//by __looking…__

// 11441
//Frodo’s gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no answer and no
//rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let Isildur go, carrying the Ring
//from the Cracks of Doom where it should have been destroyed, to the cost of all
//this war. Not for Isildur’s own sake, not for friendship had it been done, for
//the Ring had killed Isildur in the end, and far worse fates could have followed
//him. But the Doom that had stemmed from Isildur’s deed would have seemed unsure
//to Elrond then, unsure and distant in time; and yet the cost to Elrond himself
//of taking his sword’s pommel to the back of Isildur’s head would have been
//surer, and nearer…

// 11442
//As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the weathered man
//who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this council, the heir of kings who
//spoke softly to hobbits. But Frodo’s vision seemed to double, and in the
//shadowy second image Frodo saw a Man who had spent too much of his youth among
//Elves, who had learned to wear humble and stained clothes amid the gold and
//jewels, knowing he could not match them wisdom for wisdom, and hoping to
//outplay them in a fashion they would not emulate…

// 11443
//In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring’s own Maker, all
//noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of grey and darkness
//without any light. They had not made their choices knowingly, Gandalf or Elrond
//or Aragorn; the impulses had come from the dark hidden parts of themselves, the
//black secret depths which the Ring had rendered plain in Frodo’s vision. Would
//they outthink the Shadow, when they could not comprehend even their own selves,
//or the forces that moved them?

// 11444
//“Frodo!” came the sharp whisper of Bilbo’s voice, and Frodo came to himself,
//and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring lay on his breast, on its
//chain, dragging like a vast stone around his neck.

// 11445
//Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.

// 11446
//“How did you bear this thing?” Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if the two of them
//were the only souls in the room, though all the Council watched them. “For
//years? I cannot imagine it.”

// 11447
//“I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,” said his uncle,
//“and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I remembered Gollum.”

// 11448
//A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales. The horror of the Misty
//Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark; ruling the goblins from the
//shadows and filling the tunnels with traps; but for Bilbo wearing the ring that
//first time not a single dwarf would have lived. And now, Legolas the Elf had
//told them, Gollum had given up on sending his agents against the Shire, had at
//last found the courage to leave his mountains and seek the Ring himself. That
//was Gollum, the fate which Frodo would share himself, if the Ring were not
//destroyed.

// 11449
//Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.

// 11450
//The Shadow had foreseen every move they could make. Had __almost__ - Frodo
//still could not imagine how it had been done, how the Shadow had arranged such
//a thing - had __almost __maneuvered the Council into sending the Ring
//straight into Mordor with only a tiny guard set on it, as they would have done
//if Frodo and Bilbo had not been there.

// 11451
//And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the only question
//remaining was how long it would take to lose. Gandalf had delayed too long,
//delayed far too long to set this march in motion. It could have been so easy,
//if only Bilbo had set out eighty years earlier, if only Bilbo had been told
//what Gandalf had already suspected, if only Gandalf’s heart had not silently
//flinched away from the prospect of being embarrassingly wrong…

// 11452
//Frodo’s hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers began to rise
//again toward the vast weight of the chain on which the Ring hung.

// 11453
//All he had to do was put on the Ring.

// 11454
//Just that, and all would become clear to him, once more the slowness and mud
//would leave his thoughts, all possibilities and futures transparent to him, he
//would see through the Shadow’s plans and devise an irresistible counterstroke -

// 11455
//- and he would never be able to take off the Ring, not again, not by any will
  //that would be left to him. All Frodo had of those moments were fading
//memories, but he knew that it had felt like dying, to let all his towers of
//thought collapse and become only Frodo once more. It had felt like dying, he
//remembered that much of Weathertop even if he remembered little else. And if he
//did wear the Ring again, it would be better to die with it on his finger, to
//end his life while he was still himself; for Frodo knew that he could not
//withstand the effects of wearing the Ring a second time, not afterward when the
//limitless clarity was lost to him…

// 11456
//Frodo looked around the Council, at the poor lost leaderless Wise, and he knew
//they could not defeat the Shadow by their own strength.

// 11457
//“I will wear it one last time,” Frodo said, his voice broken and failing, as he
//had known from the beginning that he would say in the end, “one last time to
//find the answer for this Council, and then there will be other hobbits.”

// 11458
//“__No!__” screamed the voice of Sam, as the other hobbit began to rush
//forward from where he had hidden; even as Frodo, with movement as swift and
//precise as a Nazgﾃｻl, took out the Ring from beneath his shirt; and somehow
//Bilbo was already standing there and had already thrust his finger through.

// 11459
//It all happened before even Gandalf’s staff could point, before Aragorn could
//level the hilt-shard of his sword; the Dwarves shouted in shock, and the Elves
//were dismayed.

// 11460
//“Of course,” said Bilbo’s voice, as Frodo began to weep, “I see it now, I
//understand everything at last. Listen, listen and swiftly, here is what you
//must do -”

// 11461
//THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE

// 11462
//With a critical eye, Peter looked over the encamped Centaurs with their bows,
//Beavers with their long daggers, and talking Bears with their chain-mail draped
//over them. He was in charge, because he was one of the mythical Sons of Adam
//and had declared himself High King of Narnia; but the truth was he didn’t
//really know much about encampments, weapons, and guard patrols. In the end all
//he could see was that they all looked proud and confident, and Peter had to
//hope they were right about that; because if you couldn’t believe in your own
//people, you couldn’t believe in anyone.

// 11463
//“They’d scare __me__, if I had to fight ‘em,” Peter said finally, “but I
//don’t know if it’s enough to beat… __her.__”

// 11464
//“You don’t suppose this mysterious lion will actually show up and help us,
//d’you?” said Lucy. Her voice was very quiet, so that none of the creatures
//around them would hear. “Only it’d be nice to really have him, don’t you think,
//instead of just letting people think that he put us in charge?”

// 11465
//Susan shook her head, shaking the magical arrows in the quiver on her back. “If
//there was really someone like that,” Susan said, “he wouldn’t have let the
//White Witch cover the land in winter for a hundred years, would he?”

// 11466
//“I had the strangest dream,” Lucy said, her voice even quieter, “where we
//didn’t have to organize any creatures or convince them to fight, we just walked
//into this place and the lion was already here, with all the armies already
//mustered, and he went and rescued Edmund, and then we rode alongside him into
//this tremendous battle where he killed the White Witch…”

// 11467
//“Did the dream have a moral?” said Peter.

// 11468
//“I don’t know,” said Lucy, blinking and looking a little puzzled. “In the dream
//it all seemed pointless somehow.”

// 11469
//“I think maybe the land of Narnia was trying to tell you,” said Susan, “or
//maybe it was just your own dreams trying to tell you, that if there was really
//such a person as that lion, there’d be no use for __us__.”

// 11470
//MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS SCIENCE

// 11471
//“Applejack, who told me outright that I was mistaken, represents the spirit of…
//__honesty! __” Twilight Sparkle raised her head even higher, mane blowing
//like a wind about the dusky sky of her neck. “Fluttershy, who approached the
//manticore to find out about the thorn in its paw, represents the spirit of…
//__investigation! __Pinkie Pie, who realized that the awful faces were just
//trees, represents the spirit of… __formulating alternative hypotheses!
//__Rarity, who solved the serpent’s problem represents the spirit of…
//__creativity!__ Rainbow Dash, who saw through the false offer of her
//heart’s desire, represents the spirit of… __analysis! __Marie-Susan, who
//made us convince her that we were right before she agreed to come on our
//expedition, represents the spirit of… __peer review!__ And when those
//Elements are ignited by the spark of curiosity that resides in the heart of all
//of us, it creates the seventh element - the Element of Sci-”

// 11472
//The blast of power that came forth was like a wind of moonless night, it caught
//Marie-Susan before the pony could even flinch, and she was gone without a trace
//before any of them had the chance to rear in shock.

// 11473
//From the dark thing that stood in the center of the dais where the Elements had
//shattered, from the scarce-recognizable void-black outline of a horse, came a
//voice that seemed to bypass all ears and burn like cold fire, sounding directly
//in the brain of everypony who heard:

// 11474
//__Did you expect me to just stand there and let you finish?__

// 11475
//Twilight Sparkle stared at the space where Marie-Susan had been, where not a
//trace of the unicorn remained. __She - she just - she -__ In the back of
//her mind, unheard, she was aware that Rarity was screaming.

// 11476
//__That wasn’t a disintegration,__ said the voice of Nightmare. __I
//sent her somewhere else.__

// 11477
//Rarity’s scream stopped abruptly.

// 11478
//Twilight Sparkle felt like her own scream was only beginning. Seven. It took
//seven ponies to use the Elements of Inquiry. Everyone knew that no matter how
//honest, investigating, skeptical, creative, analytic, or curious you were, what
//really made your work Science was when you published your results in a
//prestigious journal. Everyone knew that. Could there be more than one Element
//of Peer Review at a time - how long would it take to find another one - and the
//Nightmare wouldn’t just stand there and let them do it -

// 11479
//“Where?” yelled Rainbow Dash. “Where’d you put her?”

// 11480
//__I put the little pony in the same place I bound my pathetic sister, in
//the heart of her pathetic Sun.__

// 11481
//“She’ll die!” cried Fluttershy, staring at the Nightmare in horror. “It’s too
//hot, she’ll burn!”

// 11482
//__Oh, don’t worry. The power of the Nightmare surrounds your little
//friend, keeping her safe and cool, sustaining her without food or drink. She
//will suffer nothing more than boredom…__

// 11483
//The void-black outline stepped off the dais, walking slowly, deliberately, past
//the remaining six ponies.

// 11484
//__…so long as the Nightmare’s power is not broken. By any backup plans my
//sister may have set in motion, for example, and which may be known to you. In
//that case she will vaporize instantly. Such a lovely thing, friendship. It
//makes such a wonderful instrument of blackmail. Be sure to keep safe the
//Elements of Inquiry. You wouldn’t want anyone else using them on me, now would
//you?__

// 11485
//“No,” whispered Twilight Sparkle, as the horror began to dawn on her.

// 11486
//Then a crawling sensation all over her skin, as the Nightmare walked past her,
//and the deadly power brushed her with its cold caress.

// 11487
//__Now if you’ll pardon me, my little ponies, I have an eternal night to
//rule over.__

// 11488
//THE VILLAGE HIDDEN IN THE CLARITY

// 11489
//“Consider the computational power required to manifest over a hundred shadow
//clones,” the Uchiha genius said in his dispassionate tones. “It is an error of
//rationality, Sakura, to say ‘fluke’ and think you have explained anything.
//‘Fluke’ is simply the name one gives to data that one is ignoring.”

// 11490
//“But it __has__ to be a fluke!” Sakura yelled. With effort, she calmed her
//voice into the careful precision expected of a rationality ninja; it wouldn’t
//do to have her crush think she was stupid. “Like you said, the computational
//power required to use over a hundred Kage Bunshin is simply absurd. We’re
//talking the level of a major superintelligence. Naruto’s the dead last of our
//class. He’s not even jounin-level smart, let alone a superintelligence!”

// 11491
//The Uchiha’s eyes gleamed, almost as though he had activated his Smartingan.
//“Naruto can manifest a hundred independently acting clones. He __must__
//have the raw brainpower. But, under ordinary circumstances, something prevents
//him from using this computational power efficiently… like a mind at war within
//itself, perhaps? We now have cause to believe that Naruto is in some way
//connected to a superintelligence, and as a recently graduated genin, he, like
//us, is fifteen years old. What happened fifteen years ago, Sakura?”

// 11492
//It took a moment for Sakura to comprehend, to remember, and then she
//understood.

// 11493
//The attack of the Nine-Brains Demon Fox.

// 11494
//Just a small bone-white creature with big ears and bigger tail and beady red
//eyes. It was no stronger than an ordinary fox, it didn’t breathe fire or flash
//laser eyes, it possessed no chakra and no magic of any kind, but its
//intelligence was over nine thousand times that of a human being.

// 11495
//Hundreds had been killed, half the buildings wrecked, almost the whole village
//of Beisugakure had been destroyed.

// 11496
//“You think the Kyubey is hiding inside Naruto?” Sakura said. A moment later,
//her brain automatically went on to fill in the obvious implications of the
//theory. “And the software conflict between their existences is why he acts like
//a gibbering idiot half the time, but can control a hundred Kage Bunshin. Huh.
//That makes… a lot of sense… actually…”

// 11497
//Sasuke gave her the brief, contemptuous nod of someone who had figured all this
//out on his own, without anyone else needing to prompt __him__.

// 11498
//“Ano…” said Sakura. Only years of sanity exercises channeled her complete
//screaming panic into pragmatically useful policy options. “Shouldn’t we…
//__tell__ someone about this? Like, sometime in the next five seconds?”

// 11499
//“The adults already know,” Sasuke said emotionlessly. “It is the obvious
//explanation for their treatment of Naruto. No, the real question is how this
//fits into the outwitting of the Uchiha…”

// 11500
//“I don’t see how it fits at all -” began Sakura.

// 11501
//“It __must__ fit!” A tinge of frantic emotion flickered in Sasuke’s voice.
//“I asked that man __why__ he did it, and he told me that when I knew the
//answer to that, it would explain __everything! __Surely __this__ must
//also be part of what is to be explained!”

// 11502
//Sakura sighed to herself. Her personal hypothesis was that Itachi had just been
//trying to drive his brother into clinical paranoia.

// 11503
//“Yo, kids,” said the voice of their rationality sensei from their radio
//earpieces. “There’s a village in Wave trying to build a bridge, and it keeps
//falling down for no reason anyone can figure out. Meet up at the gates at noon.

// 11507
//“And what about you?” I spat. “You coauthored a paper with Sylvie! It’s all
//right for __you__ to be prolific but not __me?__”

// 11508
//“I’m the __head of her institute__,” Richard growled. I could feel the

// 11509
//“It __is,__” I said, feeling helpless about my inability to explain things

// 11510
//“But you wanted to,” said Richard.

// 11511

//“Edward,” said Isabella tenderly. She reached up a hand and stroked his cold,

//“Excuse me,” said Jasmine. “Aladdin, my darling, you’re cute but you’re an
//idiot, do you know that? Did you not notice how once Jafar got his hands on
//this lamp, he got his own three wishes - oh, never mind. Genie, I wish for
//everyone to always be young and healthy, I wish nobody ever had to die if they
//didn’t want to, and I wish for everyone’s intelligence to gradually increase at
//a rate of 1 IQ point per year.” She tossed the lamp back to Aladdin. “Go back
//to what you were doing.”

//HAMLET

// 11552
//Interloper, abandon this strange prank,

// 11553
//which makes cruel use of the blindness of my grief,

// 11554
//and the good heart of my good friend Horatio.

// 11555
//Or else, if thou hast true title to this belov’d form,

// 11556
//tell me:

// 11557
//What drawing did I present to Hamlet King,

// 11558
//when six years old and scarce out of my sling?

// 11559
//Ghost

// 11560
//‘twas a unicorn clad all in mail.

// 11561
//HAMLET

// 11562
//What.

// 11563
//Ghost

// 11564
//Mark me.

// 11565
//HAMLET

// 11566
//Father, I will.

// 11567
//Ghost

// 11568
//My hour is almost come,

// 11569
//When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames

// 11570
//Must render up myself.

// 11571
//HAMLET

// 11572
//Thou art in torment?

// 11573
//Ghost

// 11574
//Ay, as are all who die unshriven.

// 11575
//HAMLET

// 11576
//Like every Dane this is what I’ve been taught.

// 11577
//Yet I did figure such caprice ill-suited to almighty God.

// 11578
//For all who suffer unlook’d for deaths, unattended by God’s chosen priests,

// 11579
//to be then punish’d for the ill-ordering of the world…

// 11580
//Ghost

// 11581
//‘twas not the world that killed me, nor accident of any kind.

// 11582
//HAMLET

// 11583
//What?

// 11584
//Ghost

// 11585
//If thou didst ever thy dear father love,

// 11586
//Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

// 11587
//HAMLET

// 11588
//Oh God.

// 11589
//Ghost

// 11590
//My time grows ever shorter. Wilt thou hear the tale?

// 11591
//HAMLET

// 11592
//No.

// 11593
//Ghost

// 11594
//What?

// 11595
//HAMLET

// 11596
//My love for you does call me to avenge your death,

// 11597
//but greater crimes have I heard told this night.

// 11598
//If all those murdered go to Hell, and others as well,

// 11599
//who would have confess’d had they the time,

// 11600
//If people who are, in balance, good, suffer grisly

// 11601
//at the hands of God, then I defy God’s plan.

// 11602
//Good Ghost, as one who dwells beyond the veil,

// 11603
//you know things that we mortals scarce conceive.

// 11604
//Tell me: is there some philter or device,

// 11605
//outside nature’s ken but not outside her means,

// 11606
//by which death itself may be escap’d?

// 11607
//Ghost

// 11608
//You seek to evade Hell?

// 11609
//HAMLET

// 11610
//I seek to deny Hell to everyone!

// 11611
//and Heaven too, for I suspect the Heaven of our mad God

// 11612
//might be a paltry thing, next to the Heaven I will make of Earth,

// 11613
//when I am its immortal king.

// 11614
//Ghost

// 11615
//I care not for these things.

// 11616
//Death and hell have stripp’d away all of my desires,

// 11617
//save for revenge upon my murderer.

// 11618
//HAMLET

// 11619
//Thou shalt not be avenged, save that thou swear:

// 11620
//an I slay thine killer, so wilt thou vouchsafe to me the means

// 11621
//by which I might slay death.

// 11622
//He who killed you will join you in the Pit,

// 11623
//and then that’s it. No further swelling of Hell’s ranks will I permit.

// 11624
//Ghost

// 11625
//Done. When my brother is slain, he who poured the poison in my ear,

// 11626
//then will I pour in yours the precious truth:

// 11627
//the making of the Philosopher’s Stone. With this Stone, thou may’st procure

// 11628
//a philter to render any man immune to death, and more transmute

// 11629
//base metal to gold, to fund the provision of this philter to all mankind.

// 11630
//HAMLET

// 11631
//Truly there is nothing beyond the dreaming of philosophy.

// 11632
//Wait.

// 11633
//The man whom I must kill-my uncle the king?

// 11634
//Ghost

// 11635
//Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

// 11636
//With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-

// 11637
//HAMLET

// 11638
//Indeed, he has such gifts I near despair,

// 11639
//of killing him and yet succeeding to his throne.

// 11640
//‘twill be an awesome fight for awesome stakes.

//ALICE IN THE LAND WHERE THINGS ARE EVEN CRAZIER THAN HERE

// 11651
//(as first written by **braindoll** in a review of this chapter, with some
//further edits)

// 11652
//Alice was sitting by her sister on the bank, reading a book. She had several
//friends who were older, and if she just asked nicely, they were often happy to
//lend her books without __quite__ so many pictures and conversations as was
//thought appropriate for a girl her age.

// 11653
//Hot days often made her feel sleepy and stupid, so Alice had thoughtfully wet a
//handkerchief and placed it at the back of her neck. Still her mind had gone off
//wandering (just as if it was some little kitten whose owner had taken off her
//eyes for just a moment), and she had just decided that the pleasure of making a
//daisy-chain would be worth around 4/3 of the trouble of getting up and picking
//the daisies, which was nonetheless not equal to the opportunity cost of putting
//down her book, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

// 11654
//There was nothing so __very __remarkable in that; nor, in fact, did Alice
//think it so__ very__ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
//“Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” But when the Rabbit actually __took
//a watch out of its waistcoat- pocket,__ and looked at it, and then hurried on,
//Alice froze in sudden clarity and fear, for she had never before seen a rabbit
//with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it. “Oh bother,” she
//said to herself (though not aloud; she had long since cured herself of that
//habit, as it made people take her even less seriously than they already did).
//“If I did not immediately recognize how much curiouser that was than the
//average rabbit, then something is interfering with my curiosity, and that is
//most curious of all.” So, burning with questions, she ran across the field
//after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
//hedge.

//MORPHEUS: For the longest time, I wouldn’t believe it. But then I saw the

// 11658
//NEO __(politely)__: Excuse me, please.

// 11659
//MORPHEUS: Yes, Neo?

// 11660
//NEO: I’ve kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a certain need to speak
//up at this point. The human body is the most inefficient source of energy you
//could possibly imagine. The efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal
//energy into electricity __decreases __as you run the turbines at lower
//temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans could eat, it would be more
//efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to humans. And now you’re
//telling me that their food is __the bodies of the dead, fed to the
//living?__ Haven’t you ever heard of the laws of thermodynamics?

// 11661
//MORPHEUS: Where did __you __hear about the laws of thermodynamics, Neo?

// 11662
//NEO: Anyone who’s made it past one science class in high school ought to know
//about the laws of thermodynamics!

// 11663
//MORPHEUS: Where did you go to high school, Neo?

// 11664
//(Pause.)

// 11665
//NEO: …in the Matrix.

// 11666
//MORPHEUS: The machines tell elegant lies.

// 11667
//(Pause.)

// 11668
//NEO __(in a small voice)__: Could I please have a real physics textbook?

// 11669
//MORPHEUS: There is no such thing, Neo. The universe doesn’t run on math.
