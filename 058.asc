//== TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt 8

// 10115
//A/N: A movie trailer for __Army of Darkness,__ resembling the one Harry
//saw, is THV1KkPXIxQ on YouTube.

// 10116
//The key quote is as follows, spoken by a man of modern times to listeners from
//the Middle Ages:

// 10117
//“All right you primitive screwheads! Listen up! You see this? This… is my
//__boomstick!__”

// 10118
//In darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid metal wall of
//Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other people in the world would have
//believed possible, and that none save he alone could wield.

// 10119
//Of course a powerful wizard could’ve cut through the wall in seconds, with a
//gesture and a word.

// 10120
//For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few minutes’ work, and
//afterward they would have been winded.

// 10121
//But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student, you had to be
//__efficient.__

// 10122
//Luckily - well, not __luckily__, luck had nothing to do with it -
//__conscientiously__, Harry had practiced Transfiguration for an extra hour
//every day, to the point where he was ahead of even Hermione in that one class;
//he’d practiced partial Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had
//begun taking the true universe for granted, so that it required only slightly
//more effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind, even as he kept a firm
//mental separation between the concept of Form and the concept of substance.

// 10123
//And the __problem__ with that art having become so routine…

// 10124
//…was that Harry could think about other things while he was doing it.

// 10125
//Somehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not confront the obvious,
//until he was faced with the prospect of __really actually doing it in
//just a few minutes__.

// 10126
//What Harry was about to do…

// 10127
//…was dangerous.

// 10128
//Really dangerous.

// 10129
//Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.

// 10130
//Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had been __scary,__
//but merely scary. Harry could have cast the Patronus Charm, __would__ have
//cast it as soon as he thought he was in danger of not being able to do so, as
//soon as he felt his resistance beginning to fail. And even if that hadn’t
//worked… even so, unless the Dementors had been instructed to Kiss anyone they
//found, failure shouldn’t have been __fatal.__

// 10131
//This was different.

// 10132
//The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.

// 10133
//The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in any number of
//ways and kill them.

// 10134
//The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.

// 10135
//It was just, well…

// 10136
//__Seriously__ dangerous.

// 10137
//Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing that it was
//safe.

// 10138
//And sure, the whole thing __could__ work, but…

// 10139
//But even leaving out that rationalists weren’t ever allowed to argue themselves
//into things, Harry knew he couldn’t possibly have argued himself into
//estimating less than a 20// probability of dying.

// 10140
//__Lose,__ said Hufflepuff.

// 10141
//__Lose__, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his mind.

// 10142
//__Lose,__ said his mental model of Hermione and Professor McGonagall and
//Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well, basically everyone Harry
//knew except for Fred and George, who would have gone for it in a hot second.

// 10143
//He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He should, he really
//really should, it was the only __sane__ thing to do at this point.

// 10144
//And if it’d been only Harry on the mission, only his own life that’d been at
//stake, he would have; he surely would have.

// 10145
//The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration on the partial
//Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was threatening to open him to
//the Dementors…

// 10146
//…was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.

// 10147
//If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the escape, he would die.
//He probably wouldn’t last even a week. He was that sensitive.

// 10148
//It was that simple.

// 10149
//If Harry __lost__ here…

// 10150
//He lost Professor Quirrell.

// 10151
//__Even though he’s probably evil,__ said the Hufflepuff part of him
//quietly. __Even so?__

// 10152
//It wasn’t a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way. He just couldn’t
//do it. Losing was for House points, not __people.__

// 10153
//__If you think your own life is valuable enough that you’re not willing
//to take on an eighty percent probability of dying in order to protect all the
//prisoners in Azkaban,__ his Slytherin side observed, __there’s no way you
//can justify taking a twenty percent risk to your life to save Bellatrix and
//Professor Quirrell. The math doesn’t add up, you can’t be assigning consistent
//utilities over outcomes here.__

// 10154
//The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the argument.

// 10155
//Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He could always
//just abort the mission when he was __done__ with the Transfiguration, he
//didn’t want to lose the effort he’d already invested.

// 10156
//And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it very hard to
//keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his resistance to the Dementors.

// 10157
//__What if the portkey doesn’t take us where Professor Quirrell said it
//did?__

// 10158
//It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.

// 10159
//Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the Muggle device
//worked and __didn’t__ explode and __didn’t__ interact badly with the
//mated magic item, even if the Aurors didn’t get in a lucky shot, even if Harry
//made it far enough away from Azkaban to use the portkey…

// 10160
//…there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.

// 10161
//That was something Harry had believed when he’d trusted Professor Quirrell, and
//he’d forgotten to re-evaluate it after Professor Quirrell was no longer to be
//trusted.

// 10162
//__You can’t do this,__ said Hufflepuff. __ At this point we’re
//talking mere stupidity.__

// 10163
//Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the Transfiguration
//going, even as his resistance against the Dementors faltered.

// 10164
//__I can’t lose Professor Quirrell.__

// 10165
//__He tried to kill a police officer,__ said Hufflepuff. __You
//already lost him, in that moment. Bellatrix is probably just what everyone
//thinks she is. Just take your Cloak back, go find Dumbledore and tell him you
//were tricked.__

// 10166
//__No,__ thought Harry desperately, __not without talking to
//Professor Quirrell, there might be an explanation, I don’t know, maybe he was
//standing far enough away from my Patronus that the Dementors got to him… I
//don’t understand, it doesn’t make sense on any hypothesis, why he would do
//that… I can’t just…__

// 10167
//____

// 10168
//Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it completely
//broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn’t think of feeding
//Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying resolved against Death, it was a
//cognitive impossibility.

// 10169
//__Your reasoning is artificially impaired,__ observed the logical part of
//him calmly, __find a way to unimpair it.__

// 10170
//__All right, let’s just generate alternatives,__ Harry thought.__
//Not choose, not weigh, certainly not commit… just think about what else I might
//be able to do besides the original plan.__

// 10171
//And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using partial
//Transfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two meters in diameter
//and half a millimeter thick, running all the way through the wall. He was
//Transfiguring that half-millimeter thickness of metal into motor oil. Motor oil
//was a liquid and you weren’t to Transfigure liquids because they might
//evaporate, but he and Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-Head Charms. And
//Harry would cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own
//Transfiguration…

// 10172
//…as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid out of the wall and
//onto the floor of their cell, he’d slanted it so gravity would pull it in, once
//the Transfiguration was done.

// 10173
//If Harry and Bellatrix __didn’t__ exit on his broomstick through the
//resulting hole in the wall…

// 10174
//Harry’s brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a surface cover over
//the hole in the wall, leaving a space for Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell to
//hide in, wearing the Cloak, while Harry turned himself in. And Professor
//Quirrell would eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrix could try to figure out
//how to exit Azkaban on their own.

// 10175
//It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still be a huge hunk
//of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give it away.

// 10176
//And then Harry’s brain saw the obvious.

// 10177
//__Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route you invented.
//You stay behind, and turn yourself in.__

// 10178
//Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were at stake.

// 10179
//They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.

// 10180
//And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go with them.

// 10181
//A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness that had been
//wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated. Yes, that was it, that was
//the creative outside-the-box route, that was the hidden third alternative. The
//falseness of the dilemma was obvious in retrospect. If Harry turned himself in,
//he __didn’t__ have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. If
//Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escape route, Harry
//__didn’t__ need to go with them.

// 10182
//Harry didn’t even need to face the embarrassment of admitting he’d been
//tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory. Everyone would just
//assume he’d been kidnapped, including Harry himself. Admittedly, there was no
//plausible reason why the Dark Lord would ever ask Bellatrix to do that; but
//Harry could simply smile and tell Bellatrix she wasn’t allowed to know, and
//that would be that…

// 10183
//Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down Azkaban, as had
//the other two teams on the other two spirals. Amelia was feeling tenser
//already, though she was betting on the criminals hiding on the second-to-lowest
//floor, part of her wished Dumbledore had thought to check that specific floor
//more carefully and part of her was glad he hadn’t.

// 10184
//And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny ‘tink’ noise coming from far
//away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowest floor, say.

// 10185
//Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop
//herself.

// 10186
//The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, “Since you asked it,
//Amelia,” and went off yet again.

// 10187
//“__Finite Incantatem,”__ Harry said to the oil coating the giant chunk of
//metal on the floor. He hardly heard himself speak, his ears were still ringing
//from the gigantic thud of the solid metal sliding out of the wall and falling.
//(He should have put up a Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though that wouldn’t
//have stopped the noise from spreading through the solid metal floor.) And then
//Harry said it again, “__Finite Incantatem__” to the oil coating the
//two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide; it was his own magic
//Harry was canceling, which made the spell almost effortless. Harry was feeling
//a bit tired now, but that was the last use of magic he would need. He hadn’t
//even __needed__ to do it, really, but Harry didn’t want to leave
//Transfigured liquid lying around, and he didn’t want to betray the secret of
//partial Transfiguration either.

// 10188
//It seemed very… __inviting,__ that two-meter hole leading to freedom.

// 10189
//The light from outside coming in… wasn’t exactly the Sun shining on his face,
//but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban’s interior.

// 10190
//Harry __was__ tempted to just go with, just hop on the broomstick with
//Bellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they __would__ get out safely.
//And if they __did__ get out safely, and Harry came with, then he and
//Professor Quirrell could go back in time and look perfectly innocent,
//everything could go back to normal.

// 10191
//If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in… then even if everyone assumed
//Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied to Professor McGonagall’s
//Patronus at wandpoint… even if Harry himself got off lightly, well…

// 10192
//It wasn’t likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching at Hogwarts.

// 10193
//Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his career, in
//February of the school year.

// 10194
//And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it would be slow and
//painful.

// 10195
//But staying behind was the sensible, safe, __sane__ thing to do, and Harry
//was feeling more relaxed than regretful.

// 10196
//Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a final time -

// 10197
//And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and confused, and
//the hiss said,

// 10198
//__“What wass… that noisse?__”

// 10199
//Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal door and opened
//it, already knowing from memory that the cells within were empty.

// 10200
//Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then, before he moved
//on; it would be little enough exertion in total, with so few cells left to
//check.

// 10201
//“__Teacher,__” Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up in him, all at
//once. He knew, though he could not see, that the green snake around Bellatrix’s
//shoulders, was slowly lifting its head to look around. ”__Are you… all
//right, teacher?__”

// 10202
//“__Teacher?__” came the weak, confused hiss. ”__Where iss thiss? __

// 10203
//“__Prisson,__” Harry hissed, ”__the prisson with life-eaterss, we
//were to resscue a woman, you and I. You tried to sslay the protector man, I
//blocked your killing cursse, there was a ressonance between uss… you fell
//unconssciouss, I had to defeat the protector man mysself… my guardian Charm
//wass disspelled, the life-eaterss could tell the protectorss that the woman had
//esscaped. There iss ssomeone here who can ssensse my guardian Charm, probably
//the sschoolmasster… so had to disspell my guardian Charm, find different way to
//hide you and the woman from life-eaterss without guardian Charm, learn to
//protect mysself without guardian Charm, sscare off life-eaterss without
//guardian Charm, then devisse new esscape plan for you and the woman, and
//finally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am only
//firsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If we never meet
//again, teacher, then I was glad to know you for a time, even though you are
//probably evil. It iss good to have the chance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.__”

// 10204
//And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix, saying simply,
//“Get on.”

// 10205
//He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were important. For
//another, he and the Defense Professor had started planning this a week ago, and
//Harry wasn’t about to obliterate the whole last week, __or __explain to
//Bellatrix exactly what needed to be Obliviated. Harry could probably fool
//Veritaserum, and if Dumbledore insisted that Harry drop his Occlumency shields
//for a deeper examination… well, Harry had acted heroically throughout.

// 10206
//“__Sstop!__” said the snake. Its voice was stronger now. ”__Sstop,
//sstop, sstop! What do you mean, goodbye?__”

// 10207
//“__Esscape plan iss rissky,__” said Harry. ”__My life iss not at
//sstake, only yourss and herss. Sso I am sstaying, turning mysself in -__”

// 10208
//“__No!__” said the snake. The hiss was forceful. ”__Musst not! Not
//permitted!__”

// 10209
//Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never see) her head
//turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting him, perhaps, or merely
//awaiting his orders.

// 10210
//“__No longer trusst you,__” Harry said simply. ”__Not ssince you
//tried to sslay the protector man.__”

// 10211
//And the snake hissed, “__I did not sseek to sslay the protector man! Are
//you fool, boy? Sslaying him would not make ssensse, evil or no!__”

// 10212
//The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around the Sun.

// 10213
//The snake’s hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had ever heard from
//the human Professor Quirrell. “__Sslay him? Had I ssought to sslay him he
//would have been dead within ssecondss, fool boy, he wass no match for me! I
//ssought to ssubdue, to dominate, force him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind,
//needed to read him, to know who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory
//sspell -”__

// 10214
//“__You casst killing cursse!__”

// 10215
//“__Knew he would dodge!__”

// 10216
//“__Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not dodge?__”

// 10217
//“__Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool boy!__”

// 10218
//Again the pause in the planet’s spin. Harry hadn’t thought of that.

// 10219
//“__Witlesss dunce of a plotter,__” hissed the snake, so angrily that the
//hisses seemed to overlap and slither over each other’s tails, ”__clever
//imbecile, cunning idiot, fool of an untrained Sslytherin, your missplaced
//misstrust hass ruined -”__

// 10220
//“__Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,__” Harry observed mildly. The surge
//of relief trying to flood through him was canceled by the increased tension.
//”__Ssince I cannot get angry at you properly, without opening mysself to
//life-eaterss. Musst russh, ssomeone may have heard noisse -”__

// 10221
//“__Explain esscape plan,__” the snake said imperiously.
//”__Sswiftly!__”

// 10222
//Harry explained. Parseltongue didn’t have words for the Muggle technology, but
//Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell seemed to understand.

// 10223
//There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark of surprised
//laughter, and then, snapped commands. “__Tell woman to look away, casst
//sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside door. Will transsform mysself,
//make few sswift improvementss to your invention, give woman emergency potion
//sso sshe can sshield uss, transsform back before you disspell Charm. Plan will
//be ssafer, then.__”

// 10224
//“__And am I to believe,__” Harry hissed, __“that healer for woman
//truly awaitss uss?__”

// 10225
//“__Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you here iss
//obvioussly not what I planned. Misssion iss target of opportunity, invented
//after ssaw your guardian Charm, whole affair meant to be unnoticed, hid when
//left eating-place. Obvioussly you will ssee persson pretending to be healer on
//arrival! Go back to eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on
//undissturbed!__”

// 10226
//Harry stared at the invisible snake.

// 10227
//On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather dumb.

// 10228
//And on the other hand, it wasn’t exactly reassuring.

// 10229
//“__Sso,__” Harry hissed, ”__what iss your plan for me, precissely?__”

// 10230
//“__You ssaid no time,__” came the snake’s hiss, ”__but plan iss for
//you to rule country, obvioussly, even your young noble friend hass undersstood
//that by now, assk him on return if you wissh. Will ssay no more now, iss time
//to fly, not sspeak.__”

// 10231
//The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from behind which came a
//endless dead mutter, “I’m not serious, I’m not serious, I’m not serious…” The
//red-golden phoenix on his shoulder was already screaming urgently, and the old
//wizard was already wincing, when -

// 10232
//Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the true phoenix’s call.

// 10233
//The wizard’s head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature on his other
//shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons launched the spell-entity
//into the air.

// 10234
//The false phoenix flew down the corridor.

// 10235
//The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young man of sixty.

// 10236
//The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time, hovering before the
//metal door; and then, when it became clear that its master would not return for
//all its calling, flew reluctantly after.

// 10237
//Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time - Polyjuice only lasted
//for an hour without redosing - and though the Defense Professor was pale,
//leaning against the metal bars of the nearest cell, his magic was strong enough
//to seize his wand without a word, even as Bellatrix doffed the Cloak and placed
//it obediently in Harry’s waiting hand. The sense of doom was building once
//more, though not in full force, as the Defense Professor’s power returned, the
//fringes of its vast force clashing with Harry’s slight childish aura.

// 10238
//Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it to the
//observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all his hard work back
//into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not cast spells on something Harry
//had Transfigured, for that would be an interaction, however slight, between
//their magics, but -

// 10239
//Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own Transfigured
//version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and a sweep of his wand, and
//the residue of glue was gone from the magical item; three more incantations
//later, the magical and technological were fused together as though into a
//single thing, and Charms of Unbreakability and flawless function had been cast
//upon the Muggle device.

// 10240
//(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult supervision.)

// 10241
//A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and Harry both
//commanded, “Drink,” as though speaking in the same voice. The emaciated woman
//had already been lifting it to her lips, without waiting; for it was evident to
//anyone that this snake Animagus was a servant of the Dark Lord, and a powerful
//and trusted one.

// 10242
//Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility over his head.

// 10243
//A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense Professor’s wand,
//scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge chunk of metal that lay in the
//room’s midst; as Harry had requested, saying that the method he’d used might
//identify him.

// 10244
//“Left-hand glove,” Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth, and put it on.

// 10245
//A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear upon Bellatrix’s
//shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her hand, and something like
//handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman finished drinking the potion.

// 10246
//A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix’s pale face, she
//straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far more dangerous…

// 10247
//…small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears…

// 10248
//(Harry decided not to think about that part.)

// 10249
//…and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that rang much too
//loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.

// 10250
//(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall unconscious
//and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the potion she had taken; but
//for just a few moments she would regain perhaps a twentieth part of the power
//she had once wielded.)

// 10251
//The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an instant later
//blurred into a green snake.

// 10252
//An instant after __that __the Dementors’ fear returned to the room.

// 10253
//Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured without a word;
//the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness on her back.

// 10254
//Harry said “Up!” to the broomstick.

// 10255
//Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.

// 10256
//Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead position.

// 10257
//Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on her wrists and
//chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick, even as Harry’s right hand
//shoved his wand into his pouch.

// 10258
//And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall -

// 10259
//- emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors’ pit, in the
  //interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the blue sky now
//clearly visible above them, shining down its daylight.

// 10260
//Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and toward the
//center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to prevent direct contact
//between his skin and something which Professor Quirrell had Transfigured, held
//the switch of the control on the Muggle device.

// 10261
//Far above them, distant shouts rang out.

// 10262
//__All right, you primitive screwheads!__

// 10263
//Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, diving straight down
//toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing downward as the first shots
//were fired.

// 10264
//__Listen up!__

// 10265
//____

// 10266
//“Protego Maximus!” shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice, followed by a
//cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded them.

// 10267
//__You see this?__

// 10268
//From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred Dementors rose
//into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of corpses, a flying graveyard;
//appearing to another as a conglomerate of absences that seemed to form one vast
//rip in the world as they slid upward.

// 10269
//__This…__

// 10270
//The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible incantation,
//and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the hole in Azkaban’s wall,
//shapeless for only a moment before it began to form wings.

// 10271
