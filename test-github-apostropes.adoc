== Test of github apostrophes

Dear GitHub, I've got a problem in Diff View of the following line:

Пам'ятайте, тут з кирилицею коїться щось дивне. Пам'ятайте.

In previous line between two ' symbols text is shown in italics. It shouldn't.
Those are cyrillic letters, between letters asciidoctor changes ' to apostrophe,
it doesn't indicate italics.

From user manual (http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/):

[quote]
____
When entered with the ' key, Asciidoctor renders an apostrophe that is directly
preceded and followed by a character, such as in contractions and possessive
singular forms, as a curved apostrophe.
