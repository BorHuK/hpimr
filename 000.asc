//Reviews make me happy. You can leave reviews on any chapter, no login required,
//and there’s no need to finish reading it all before you start reviewing
//chapters - but do please leave at most __one __review per chapter.

// 22
//This is __not__ a strict single-point-of-departure fic - there exists a
//primary point of departure, at some point in the past, but also other
//alterations. The best term I’ve heard for this fic is “parallel universe”.

// 23
//The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, truly
//obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode, and
//massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story; its
//mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.

// 24
//The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of a TV show
//running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose episodes are individually
//plotted but with an overall arc building to a final conclusion.

// 25
//The story has been corrected to British English up to Ch. 17, and further
//Britpicking is currently in progress (see the /HPMOR subreddit).

// 26
//All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the
//realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author.
//Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered
//by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.
