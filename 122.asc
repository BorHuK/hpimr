// 19940
//== Something to Protect: Hermione Granger

// 19941
//And it was evening and it was morning, the last day. June 15th, 1992.

// 19942
//The beginning light of morning, the pre-dawn before sunrise, was barely
//brightening the sky. To the east of Hogwarts, where the Sun would rise, that
//faintest tinge of grey made barely visible the hilly horizon beyond the
//Quidditch stands.

// 19943
//The stone terrace-platform where Harry now sat would be high enough to see the
//dawn beyond the hills below; he’d asked for that, when he was describing his
//new office.

// 19944
//Harry was currently sitting cross-legged on a cushion, chilly pre-morning
//breezes stirring over his exposed hands and face. He’d ordered the house-elves
//to bring up the hand-glittered throne from his previous office as General
//Chaos… and then he’d told the elves to put it back, once it had occurred to
//Harry to start worrying about where his taste in decorations had come from and
//whether Voldemort had once possessed a similar throne. Which, itself, wasn’t a
//knockdown argument - it wasn’t like sitting on a glittery throne to survey the
//lands below Hogwarts was __unethical__ in any way Harry’s moral philosophy
//could make out - but Harry had decided that he needed to take time and think it
//through. Meanwhile, simple cushions would do well enough.

// 19945
//In the room below, connected to the rooftop by a simple wooden ladder, was
//Harry’s new office inside Hogwarts. A wide room, surrounded by full-wall
//windows on four sides for sunlight; currently bare of furnishings but for four
//chairs and a desk. Harry had told Headmistress McGonagall what he was looking
//for, and Headmistress McGonagall had put on the Sorting Hat and then told Harry
//the series of twists and turns that would take him where he wanted to be. High
//enough in Hogwarts that the castle shouldn’t have been that tall, high enough
//in Hogwarts that nobody looking from the outside would see a piece of castle
//corresponding to where Harry now sat. It seemed like an elementary precaution
//against snipers that there was no reason __not__ to take.

// 19946
//Though, on the flip side, Harry had no idea where he currently __was__ in
//any real sense. If his office couldn’t be seen from the lands below, then how
//was Harry seeing the lands, how were photons making it from the landscape to
//him? On the western side of the horizon, stars still glittered, clear in the
//pre-dawn air. Were those photons the actual photons that had been emitted by
//huge plasma furnaces in the unimaginable distance? Or did Harry now sit within
//some dreaming vision of the Hogwarts castle? Or was it all, without any further
//explanation, ‘just magic’? He needed to get electricity to work better around
//magic so he could experiment with shining lasers downward and upward.

// 19947
//And yes, Harry had his own office on Hogwarts now. He didn’t have any official
//title yet, but the Boy-Who-Lived was now a true fixture of the Hogwarts School
//of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the soon-to-be-home of the Philosopher’s Stone and
//the world’s only wizarding institution of genuinely higher education. It wasn’t
//fully secured, but Professor Vector had put up some preliminary Charms and
//Runes to screen the office and its rooftop against eavesdropping.

// 19948
//Harry sat on his cushion, near the edge of his office’s roof, and gazed down
//upon trees and lakes and flowering grass. Far below, carriages sat
//motionlessly, not yet harnessed to skeletal horses. Small boats littered the
//shore, prepared to ferry younger students across the lake when the time came.
//The Hogwarts Express had arrived overnight, and now the train cars and the huge
//old-fashioned engine awaited on the other side of the southern lake. All was
//ready to take the students home after the Leave-Taking Feast in the morning.

// 19949
//Harry stared across the lake, at the great old-fashioned locomotive he wouldn’t
//be riding home this time. Again. There was a strange sadness and worry to that
//thought, like Harry was already starting to miss out on the bonding experiences
//with __the other students his age__ - if you could say that at all, when a
//significant part of Harry had been born in 1926. It had felt to Harry, last
//night in the Ravenclaw common room, like the gap between him and the other
//students had, yes, widened even further. Though that might only have been from
//the questions Padma Patil and Anthony Goldstein had excitedly asked each other
//about the Girl-Who-Revived, the rapid-fire speculations shooting through the
//air from Ravenclaw to Ravenclaw. Harry had known the answers, he’d known all
//the answers, and he hadn’t been able to say them.

// 19950
//There was a part of Harry that was tempted to go on the Hogwarts Express and
//then come back to Hogwarts by Floo. But when Harry imagined finding five other
//students for his compartment, and then spending the next eight hours keeping
//secrets from Neville or Padma or Dean or Tracey or Lavender… it didn’t seem
//like an attractive prospect. Harry felt like he ought to do it for reasons of
//Socializing with the Other Children, but he did not, in any real sense,
//__want__ to do it. He could meet with everyone again at the start of the
//next school year, when there would be other topics of which he could speak more
//freely.

// 19951
//Harry stared south across the lake, at the huge old locomotive, and thought
//about the rest of his life.

// 19952
//About the Future.

// 19953
//The prophecy Dumbledore’s letter had mentioned about him tearing apart the
//stars in heaven… well, __that__ sounded optimistic. That part had an
//obvious interpretation to anyone who’d grown up with the right sort of
//upbringing. It described a future where humanity had won, more or less. It
//wasn’t what Harry usually thought about when he gazed at the stars, but from a
//truly __adult__ perspective, the stars were enormous heaps of valuable raw
//materials that had unfortunately caught fire and needed to be scattered and put
//out. If you were tapping the huge hydrogen-helium reservoirs for raw materials,
//that meant your species had successfully grown up.

// 19954
//Unless the prophecy had been referring to something else entirely. Dumbledore
//might have been misinterpreting some seer’s words… but his message to Harry had
//been phrased as if there’d been a prophecy about Harry __personally__
//tearing apart stars, in the foreseeable future. Which seemed potentially more
//worrisome, though by no means certain to be true, or a bad thing if it was
//true…

// 19955
//Harry vented a sigh. He’d begun to understand, in the long hours before sleep
//had taken him last night, just what Dumbledore’s last messageimplied.

// 19956
//Looking back on the events of the 1991-1992 Hogwarts school year was nothing
//short of bone-freezingly terrifying, now that Harry understood what he was
//seeing.

// 19957
//It wasn’t just that Harry had kept the frequent company of his good friend Lord
//Voldemort. It wasn’t even __mostly__ that.

// 19958
//It was the vision of a narrow line of Time that Albus Dumbledore had steered
//through fate’s narrow keyhole, a hair-thin strand of possibility threaded
//through a needle’s eye.

// 19959
//The prophecies had instructed Dumbledore to have Tom Riddle’s intelligence
//copied onto the brain of a wizarding infant who would then grow up learning
//Muggle science. What did it say about the likely shape of the Future, if
//__that__ was the first or best strategy the seers could find that
//__didn’t __lead to catastrophe?

// 19960
//Harry could look back now on the Unbreakable Vow that he’d made, and guess that
//if not for that Vow, disaster might have already been set in motion yesterday
//when Harry had wanted to tear down the International Statute of Secrecy. Which
//in turn strongly suggested that the many prophecies Dumbledore had read and
//whose instructions he’d followed, had somehow ensured that Harry and Voldemort
//would collide in __exactly the right __way to cause Voldemort to force
//Harry to make that Unbreakable Vow. That the Unbreakable Vow had been part of
//Time’s narrow keyhole, one of the improbable preconditions for allowing the
//Earth’s peoples to survive.

// 19961
//A Vow whose sole purpose was to protect everyone from Harry’s current
//__stupidity__.

// 19962
//It was like watching a videotape of an almost-traffic-accident that had
//happened to you, where you remembered another car missing you by centimeters,
//and the video showing that somebody had __also__ thrown a pebble in
//exactly the right way to cause an enormous lorry to miss that near-collision,
//and if they hadn’t thrown that pebble then you and all your family in the
//automobile and your __entire planet __would have been hit by the lorry,
//which, in the metaphor, represented your own__ sheer obliviousness.__

// 19963
//Harry had been __warned,__ he’d __known__ on some level or the Vow
//wouldn’t have stopped him, and yet he’d __still__ almost made the wrong
//choice and destroyed the world. Harry could look back now and see that, yes,
//the alternate-Harry with no Vow would’ve had trouble accepting the reasoning
//that said you couldn’t get magical healing to Muggles as fast as possible. If
//the alternate-Harry had acknowledged the danger at all, he would have
//rationalized it, tried to figure out some clever way around the problem and
//refused to accept__ taking a few years longer to do it,__ and so the world
//would have ended. Even after all the warnings Harry had received, it
//__still__ wouldn’t have worked without the Unbreakable Vow.

// 19964
//One tiny strand of Time, being threaded through a needle’s eye.

// 19965
//Harry didn’t know how to handle this revelation. It wasn’t a sort of situation
//that human beings had evolved emotions to handle. All Harry could do was stare
//at how close he had come to disaster, might come __again__ to disaster if
//that Vow was fated to trigger more than once, and think…

// 19966
//Think…

// 19967
//‘I don’t want that to happen again’ didn’t seem like the right thought. He’d
//never __wanted__ to destroy the world in the first place. Harry hadn’t
//lacked for protective feelings about Earth’s sapient population, those
//protective feelings had been the __problem__ in a way. What Harry had
//lacked was some element of clear vision, of being willing to consciously
//acknowledge what he’d already known deep down.

// 19968
//And the whole thing with Harry having spent the last year cozying up to the
//Defense Professor didn’t speak highly of his intellect either. It seemed to
//point to the same problem, even. There were things Harry had known or strongly
//suspected on some level, but never promoted to conscious attention. And so he
//had failed and nearly died.

// 19969
//__I need to raise the level of my game.__

// 19970
//That was the thought Harry was looking for. He had to do better than this,
//become a less stupid person than this.

// 19971
//__I need to raise the level of my game, or fail.__

// 19972
//Dumbledore had destroyed the recordings in the Hall of Prophecy and arranged
//for no further recordings to be made. There’d apparently been a prophecy that
//said Harry mustn’t look upon those prophecies. And the obvious next thought,
//which might or might not be true, was that saving the world was __beyond
//the reach of prophetic instruction__. That winning would take plans that were
//too complex for seers’ messages, or that Divination couldn’t see somehow. If
//there’d been some way for Dumbledore to save the world himself, then prophecy
//would probably have told Dumbledore how to do that. Instead the prophecies had
//told Dumbledore how to create the preconditions for a particular sort of person
//existing; a person, maybe, who could unravel a challenge more difficult than
//prophecy could solve directly. That was why Harry had been placed on his own,
//to think without prophetic guidance. If all Harry did was follow mysterious
//orders from prophecies, then he wouldn’t mature into a person who could perform
//that unknown task.

// 19973
//And right now, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was still a walking disaster
//who’d needed to be constrained by an Unbreakable Vow to prevent him from
//__immediately__ setting the Earth on an inevitable course toward
//destruction __when he’d already been warned against it.__ That had
//happened __literally yesterday,__ just one day after he’d helped Voldemort
//almost take over the planet.

// 19974
//A certain line from Tolkien kept running through Harry’s mind, the part where
//Frodo upon Mount Doom put on the ring, and Sauron suddenly realized what a
//__complete idiot__ he’d been. ‘And the magnitude of his own folly was at
//last laid bare’, or however that had gone.

// 19975
//There was a huge gap between who Harry needed to become, and who he was right
//now.

// 19976
//And Harry didn’t think that time, life experience, and puberty would take care
//of that automatically, though they might help. Though if Harry could grow into
//an adult that was to __this__ self what a normal adult was to a normal
//eleven-year-old, maybe __that__ would be enough to steer through Time’s
//narrow keyhole…

// 19977
//He had to grow up, somehow, and there was no traditional path laid out before
//him for accomplishing that.

// 19978
//The thought came then to Harry of another work of fiction, more obscure than
//Tolkien:

// 19979
//__You can only arrive at mastery by practicing the techniques you have
//learned, facing challenges and apprehending them, using to the fullest the
//tools you have been taught, until they shatter in your hands and you are left
//in the midst of wreckage absolute… I cannot create masters. I have never known
//how to create masters. Go, then, and fail… You have been shaped into something
//that may emerge from the wreckage, determined to remake your Art. I cannot
//create masters, but if you had not been taught, your chances would be less. The
//higher road begins after the Art seems to fail you; though the reality will be
//that it was you who failed your Art.__

// 19980
//It wasn’t that Harry had gone down the __wrong__ path, it wasn’t that the
//road to sanity lay somewhere outside of science. But reading science papers
//hadn’t been __enough.__ All the cognitive psychology papers about known
//bugs in the human brain and so on had __helped,__ but they hadn’t been
//__sufficient.__ He’d failed to reach what Harry was starting to realise
//was a __shockingly__ high standard of being so incredibly, unbelievably
//rational that you actually started to __get things right,__ as opposed to
//having a handy language in which to describe afterwards everything you’d just
//done wrong. Harry could look back now and apply ideas like ‘motivated
//cognition’ to see where he’d gone astray over the last year. That counted for
//something, when it came to being saner in the future. That was better than
//having no idea what he’d done wrong. But that wasn’t yet being the person who
//could pass through Time’s narrow keyhole, the adult form whose
//__possibility__ Dumbledore had been instructed by seers to create.

// 19981
//__I need to think faster, grow up faster… How alone am I, how alone will
//I be? Am I making the same mistake I made during Professor Quirrell’s first
//battle, when I didn’t realise Hermione had captains? The mistake I made when I
//didn’t tell Dumbledore about the sense of doom, once I realised Dumbledore
//probably wasn’t mad or evil?__

// 19982
//It would help if Muggles had classes for this sort of thing, but they didn’t.
//Maybe Harry could recruit Daniel Kahneman, fake his death, rejuvenate him with
//the Stone, and put him in charge of inventing better training methods…

// 19983
//Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, gazed again at the dark-grey wood
//that Dumbledore had passed down to him. Harry had __tried__ to think
//faster this time, he’d tried to complete the pattern implied by the Cloak of
//Invisibility and the Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility had
//possessed the legendary power of hiding the wearer, and the hidden power of
//allowing the wearer to hide from Death itself in the form of Dementors. The
//Resurrection Stone had the legendary power of summoning an image of the dead,
//and then Voldemort had incorporated it into his horcrux system to allow his
//spirit to move freely. The second Deathly Hallow was a potential component of a
//system of true immortality that Cadmus Peverell had never completed, maybe due
//to his having ethics.

// 19984
//And then there was the third Deathly Hallow, the Elder Wand of Antioch
//Peverell, that legend said passed from wizard to stronger wizard, and made its
//holder invincible against ordinary attacks; that was the known and overt
//characteristic…

// 19985
//The Elder Wand that had belonged to Dumbledore, who’d been trying to prevent
//the Death of the world itself.

// 19986
//The purpose of the Elder Wand always going to the victor might be to find the
//strongest living wizard and empower them still further, in case there was any
//threat to their entire species; it could secretly be a tool to defeat Death in
//its form as the destroyer of worlds.

// 19987
//But if there was some higher power locked within the Elder Wand, it had not
//presented itself to Harry based on that guess. Harry had raised up the Elder
//Wand and spoken to it, named himself a descendant of Peverell who accepted his
//family’s quest; he’d promised the Elder Wand that he would do his best to save
//the world from Death, and take up Dumbledore’s duty. And the Elder Wand had
//answered no more strongly to his hand than before, refusing his attempt to jump
//ahead in the story. Maybe Harry needed to strike his first true blow against
//the Death of worlds before the Elder Wand would acknowledge him; as the heir of
//Ignotus Peverell had already defeated Death’s shadow, and the heir of Cadmus
//Peverell had already survived the Death of his body, when their respective
//Deathly Hallows had revealed their secrets.

// 19988
//At least Harry had managed to guess that, contrary to legend, the Elder Wand
//didn’t contain a core of ‘Thestral hair’. Harry had seen Thestrals, and they
//were skeletal horses with smooth skin and no visible mane on their skull-like
//heads, nor tufts on their bony tails. But what core was truly inside the Elder
//Wand, Harry hadn’t yet felt himself knowing; nor had he been able to find,
//anywhere on the Elder Wand, the circle-triangle-line of the Deathly Hallows
//that should have been present.

// 19989
//“I don’t suppose,” Harry murmured to the Elder Wand, “you could just tell me?”

// 19990
//There came back no answer from the globe-knobbed wand; only a sense of glory
//and contained power, watching him skeptically.

// 19991
//Harry sighed, and put the most powerful wand in the world back into his school
//robes. He’d get it eventually, and hopefully in time.

// 19992
//Maybe faster, if there was someone to help him do the research.

// 19993
//Harry was aware on some level - no, he needed to stop being aware of things
//__on some level__ and start just being aware of them - Harry was
//explicitly and consciously aware that he was ruminating about the Future mostly
//to distract himself from the imminent arrival of Hermione Granger. Who would
//receive a clear bill of health from St. Mungo’s, when she woke up very early
//this morning, and who would then Floo with Professor Flitwick back to Hogwarts.
//Whereupon she’d tell Professor Flitwick that she needed to speak with Harry
//Potter immediately. There’d been a note from Harry to himself about that, when
//Harry had woken up later this morning with the sun already risen in the
//Ravenclaw dorm. He’d read the note, and then Time-Turned back to before the
//dawn hour when Hermione Granger would arrive.

// 19994
//__She won’t actually be angry with me.__

// 19995
//…

// 19996
//__Seriously. Hermione isn’t that kind of person. Maybe she was at the
//start of the year but she’s too self-aware to fall for that one now.__

// 19997
//…

// 19998
//__What do you mean, ‘…’? If you have something to say, inner voice, just
//say it! We’re trying to be more aware of our own thought processes, remember?__

// 19999
//The sky had gone full blue-gray, dawn barely short of sunrise, by the time that
//Harry heard the sound of footsteps coming from the ladder that opened into his
//new office. Hastily Harry stood up and began to brush off his robes; and then,
//realising what he was doing, stopped the nervous motions. He’d just defeated
//Voldemort, damn it, he ought not to be this nervous.

// 20000
//The young witch’s head and chestnut curls appeared in the opening and peered
//around. Then she rose up higher, seemed almost to run up the ladder steps, like
//she was walking along an ordinary sidewalk but vertically; Harry could have
//blinked and missed it, how her one shoe came down on the top rung of the ladder
//and then she leaped lightly onto the roof an instant later.

// 20001
//__Hermione.__ Harry’s lips moved around the word, but made no sound.

// 20002
//There’d been something Harry had meant to say, but it had gone right out of his
//mind.

// 20003
//Maybe a quarter of the minute passed, on the rooftop, before Hermione Granger
//spoke. She was wearing a blue-edged uniform now, and the blue-bronze-striped
//tie of her proper House.

// 20004
//“Harry,” said Hermione Granger, a terribly familiar voice that almost brought
//tears to Harry’s eyes, “before I ask you all the questions, I’d like to start
//by saying thank you very much for, um, whatever it is you did. I mean it,
//really. Thank you.”

// 20005
//“Hermione,” Harry said, and swallowed. The phrase __may I have permission
//to hug you,__ which Harry had imagined using for his opening line, seemed
//impossible to say. “Welcome back. Hold on while I put up some privacy spells.”
//Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, got a book from his pouch that he
//opened to a bookmark, and then carefully pronounced “__Homenum Revelio,__”
//along with two other recently-acquired security Charms that Harry had found
//himself barely able to cast if he wielded the Elder Wand. It wasn’t much, but
//it was marginally better security than just relying on Professor Vector.

// 20006
//“You have Dumbledore’s wand,” Hermione said. Her voice was hushed, and sounded
//as loud as an avalanche in the still dawn air. “And you can use it to cast
//fourth-year spells?”

// 20007
//Harry nodded, making a mental note to be more careful who else saw him do that.
//“Is it okay if I hug you?”

// 20008
//Hermione moved lightly over to him; her movements were peculiarly swift, more
//graceful than they’d been before. Her motions seemed to radiate an air of
//something pure and untouched, reminding Harry again of how peaceful Hermione
//had looked when she was sleeping on Voldemort’s altar -

// 20009
//Realization hit Harry like a ton of bricks, or at least a kilogram of brick.

// 20010
//And Harry hugged Hermione, feeling how very __alive__ she seemed. He felt
//like crying, and suppressed it, because he didn’t know whether that was just
//her aura affecting him or not.

// 20011
//Hermione’s arms around him were gentle, exceedingly light in their pressure, as
//if she were being deliberately careful not to snap his body in half like a used
//toothpick.

// 20012
//“So,” Hermione said, once Harry had let go of her. Her young face looked very
//serious, as well as pure and innocent. “I didn’t tell the Aurors you were
//there, or that it was Professor Quirrell and not You-Know-Who who killed all
//the Death Eaters. Professor Flitwick only let them give me one drop of
//Veritaserum, so I didn’t have to say. I just told them the troll was the last
//thing I remembered.”

// 20013
//“Ah,” Harry said. He had somehow found himself staring at Hermione’s nose
//instead of her eyes. “What do you think happened, exactly?”

// 20014
//“Well,” Hermione Granger said consideringly, “I got eaten by a troll, which I’d
//frankly rather not do again, and then there was a really loud __bang__ and
//my legs were back, and I was lying on a stone altar in the middle of a
//graveyard in a dark moonlit forest I’d never seen before, with somebody’s
//severed hands clutched around my throat. So you see, Mr. Potter, finding myself
//in a situation that weird and dark and scary, I wasn’t going to make the same
//mistake I did last time with Tracey. I knew __right away__ that it was
//you.”

// 20015
//Harry nodded. “Good call.”

// 20016
//“I said your name, but you didn’t answer,” said Hermione. “I sat up and one of
//the bloody hands slid down over my shirt, leaving little bits of flesh behind.
//I didn’t scream though, even when I looked around and saw all the heads and
//bodies and realized what the smell was.” Hermione stopped, took another deep
//breath. “I saw the skull masks and realized that the dead people had been Death
//Eaters. I knew right away that the Defense Professor had been there with you
//and killed them all, but I didn’t notice Professor Quirrell’s body was also
//there. I didn’t realize it was him even when I saw Professor Flitwick checking
//the body. He looked… different, when he was dead.” Hermione’s voice became
//quieter. She looked humbled somehow, in a way Harry couldn’t often remember
//seeing. “They said David Monroe sacrificed his life to bring me back, the same
//way your mother sacrificed herself for you, so that the Dark Lord would explode
//again when he tried to touch me. I’m __pretty__ sure that’s not the whole
//truth, but… I’ve thought a lot of nasty things about our Defense Professor that
//I never should’ve thought.”

// 20017
//“Um,” Harry said.

// 20018
//Hermione nodded solemnly, her hands clasped in front of her as though in
//penitence. “I know you’re probably too nice to say the things to me that you
//have a right to say now, so I’ll say them for you, Harry. You were right about
//Professor Quirrell, and I was wrong. You told me so. David Monroe was a little
//bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin, and it was childish of me to think that was
//the same thing as being evil.”

// 20019
//“Ah…” Harry said. This was very hard to say. “Actually, the rest of the world
//doesn’t know this part, not even the Headmistress. But in point of fact you
//were one hundred and twelve percent correct about him being evil, and I’ll
//remember for future reference that although ‘Dark’ and ‘evil’ may not
//technically be the same thing, there’s a great big statistical correlation.”

// 20020
//“Oh,” said Hermione, and fell silent again.

// 20021
//“You’re not saying that you told me so?” said Harry. His mental model of
//Hermione was yelling: I TOLD YOU SO! DIDN’T I TELL YOU SO, MR. POTTER? DIDN’T I
//TELL YOU? PROFESSOR QUIRRELL IS EEEEVIIIL, I SAID, BUT __YOU DIDN’T
//LISTEN TO ME!__

// 20022
//The actual Hermione just shook her head. “I know you cared about him a lot,”
//she said softly. “Since I was right after all… I knew you’d probably be hurting
//a lot after Professor Quirrell turned out to be evil, and that it wouldn’t be a
//good time to say I told you so. I mean, that’s what I decided when I was
//thinking that part through several months earlier.”

// 20023
//__Thank you, Miss Granger.__ Harry was glad she’d said that much, though,
//it just wouldn’t have felt like Hermione otherwise.

// 20024
//“So, Mr. Potter,” said Hermione Granger, tapping her fingers on her robe at
//around thigh level. “After the medi-witch drew my blood, it stopped hurting
//right away, and when I brushed away the little bit of blood on my arm, I
//couldn’t find where the needle had poked me. I bent some of the metal in my
//bedframe without trying hard, and though I haven’t had a chance to test it yet,
//I feel like I should be able to runreally__ fast.__ My fingernails are
//pearly-white and shiny even though I don’t remember painting them. And my teeth
//look like that too, which, being the daughter of dentists, makes me nervous. So
//it’s not that I’m ungrateful, but just what exactly did you do?”

// 20025
//“Um,” Harry said. “And I’m expecting you’re also wondering why you’re radiating
//an aura of purity and innocence?”

// 20026
//“I’m WHAT?”

// 20027
//“That part wasn’t my idea. Honestly.” Harry’s voice went small. “Please don’t
//kill me.”

// 20028
//Hermione Granger raised her hands in front of her face, staring somewhat
//cross-eyed at her fingers. “Harry, are you saying… I mean, my radiating
//innocence and being all strong and fast and my teeth being pearly white… is it
//__alicorn__ my fingernails are made of?”

// 20029
//“Alicorn?”

// 20030
//“It’s the term for unicorn horn, Mr. Potter.” Hermione Granger seemed to be
//trying to nibble her fingernails, and not having much luck. “So, I guess if you
//bring a girl back from the dead she ends up as, what did Daphne call it, a
//Sparkling Unicorn Princess?”

// 20031
//“That’s not exactly what happened,” Harry said, though it was frighteningly
//close.

// 20032
//Hermione took her finger out of her mouth, frowning at it. “I can’t bite
//through it either. Mr. Potter, did you consider the problems now that it’s
//literally impossible for me to trim my fingernails and toenails?”

// 20033
//“The Weasley twins have a magical sword that should work,” Harry volunteered.

// 20034
//“I think,” Hermione Granger said firmly, “that I would like to know the whole
//story behind all this, Mr. Potter. Because knowing you and knowing Professor
//Quirrell, there was some sort of __plan__ going on.”

// 20035
//Harry took a deep breath. Then he exhaled. “Sorry, it’s… classified. I could
//tell you if you studied Occlumency, but… do you want to?”

// 20036
//“Do I want to study Occlumency?” Hermione said, looking slightly surprised.
//“That’s at least a sixth-year thing, isn’t it?”

// 20037
//“I learned it,” Harry said. “I started with an unusual boost, but I doubt that
//really mattered in the long run. I mean, I’m sure you could learn calculus if
//you studied hard, regardless of what age Muggles usually learn it. The question
//is, um.” Harry was having to control his breathing. “The question is, do you
//still want to do… that kind of stuff.”

// 20038
//Hermione turned, and looked at where the sky was lightening in the east. “You
//mean,” she said quietly, “do I still want to be a hero now that it’s earned me
//a horrible death that one time.”

// 20039
//Harry nodded, then said “Yes” because Hermione wasn’t turning toward him,
//though the word felt blocked in his throat.

// 20040
//“I’ve been thinking about that,” Hermione said. “It was, in fact, an
//exceptionally gruesome and painful death.”

// 20041
//“I, um. I did set some things up __just__ __in case __you still
//wanted to be a hero. There were some short windows of opportunity where I
//didn’t have time to consult you, I couldn’t let you see me because I expected
//you to be given Veritaserum later. But if you don’t like it, I can undo most of
//what I did and you can just ignore the rest.”

// 20042
//Hermione nodded distantly. “Like making everyone think that I… Harry,
//__did__ I actually do anything to You-Know-Who?”

// 20043
//“No, that was all me, though please don’t tell anyone that. Just so you know,
//that time the Boy-Who-Lived supposedly defeated Voldemort, on the night of
//Halloween in 1981, that was Dumbledore’s victory and he let everyone think it
//was me. So now I’ve defeated a Dark Lord once, and gotten credit for it once.
//It all balances out eventually, I guess.”

// 20044
//Hermione went on gazing to the east, toward where London lay in the unseeable
//distance. “I’m not really comfortable with this,” she said after a while.
//“People thinking I defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, when I haven’t done
//anything at all… oh, that’s the same thing you went through, isn’t it?”

// 20045
//“Yeah. Sorry about inflicting that on you. I was… well, I was trying to create
//a separate identity for you in people’s minds, I guess. There was just the one
//opportunity and everything was sort of __rushed__ and… I realized
//afterwards that maybe I shouldn’t have, but it was too late.” Harry cleared his
//throat. “Though, um. If you’re feeling like you want to do something that’s
//actually worthy of the way people think about the Girl-Who-Revived, um. I might
//have an idea for what you can do. Very soon, if you want.”

// 20046
//Hermione Granger was giving him a __look.__

// 20047
//“But you don’t __have__ to!” Harry said hastily. “You can just ignore this
//whole thing and be the best student in Ravenclaw! If that’s what you prefer.”

// 20048
//“Are you trying to use reverse psychology on me, Mr. Potter?”

// 20049
//“No! Honestly!” Harry took a deep breath. “I’m __trying__ not to decide
//your life for you. I thought I saw, yesterday, I thought I saw what might come
//next for you - but then I remembered how much of this year I’d spent being a
//total idiot. I thought of some things Dumbledore said to me. I realized it
//genuinely wasn’t my place to say. That you could do anything you wanted with
//your life, and that above all, the choice had to be your own. Maybe you
//__don’t__ want to be a hero after this, maybe you want to become a great
//magical researcher because that’s who Hermione Granger really was all along,
//never mind what your fingernails are made out of now. Or you could go to the
//Salem Witches’ Institute in America instead of Hogwarts. I won’t lie and say
//I’d like that, but it really is up to you.” Harry turned to the horizon and
//swept his hand wide, as though to indicate all the world that lay beyond
//Hogwarts. “You can go __anywhere__ from here. You can do __anything__
//with your life. If you want to be a wealthy sixty-year-old merman, I can make
//it happen. I’m serious.”

// 20050
//Hermione nodded slowly. “I’m curious about how you’d do that exactly, but what
//I want isn’t to have things done __for__ me.”

// 20051
//Harry sighed. “I understand. Um…” Harry hesitated. “I think… if it helps you to
//know… in my case, things were being arranged for me a __lot__. By
//Dumbledore, mostly, though Professor Quirrell the power to earn your own way in
//life is itself something you have to earn.”

// 20052
//“Why, that sounds very wise,” Hermione said. “Like having my parents pay for me
//to go to college, so I can someday get my own job. Professor Quirrell bringing
//me back to life as a Sparkling Unicorn Princess and you telling everyone that I
//offed the Dark Lord Voldemort is just like that, really.”

// 20053
//“I __am__ sorry,” Harry said. “I know I should’ve done it differently,
//but… I didn’t have much time to plan and I was exhausted and not really
//thinking straight -”

// 20054
//“I’m grateful, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice softer now. “You’re being too
//harsh on yourself, even. Please don’t take it so seriously when I’m snarky at
//you. I don’t want to be the sort of girl who comes back from the dead, and then
//starts complaining about which superpowers she got and that her alicorn
//fingernails are the wrong shade of pearly white.” Hermione had turned, was
//again gazing off at the east. “But, Mr. Potter… if I __do__ decide that
//dying a horrible death isn’t enough to make me rethink my life choices… not
//that I’m saying that just yet… then what happens next?”

// 20055
//“I do my best to support you in your life choices,” Harry said firmly.
//“Whatever they are.”

// 20056
//“You have a quest already lined up for me, I’m guessing. A nice safe quest
//where there’s no chance of my getting hurt again.”

// 20057
//Harry rubbed his eyes, feeling tired inside. It was like he could hear the
//voice of Albus Dumbledore inside his head. __Forgive me, Hermione
//Granger…__ “I’m sorry, Hermione. If you go down that path I’m going to have to
//Dumbledore you, and not tell you some things. Manipulate you, if only for a
//short while. I do believe there’s something you might be able to do now,
//something real, something worthy of the way people are thinking about the
//Girl-Who-Revived… that you might have a destiny, even… but in the end that’s
//just a guess, I know a lot less than Dumbledore did. Are you willing to risk
//the life you just got back?”

// 20058
//Hermione turned to look at him, her eyes widening in surprise. “__Risk my
//life?__”

// 20059
//Harry didn’t nod, because that would have been outright lying. “Are you willing
//to do that?” Harry said instead. “The quest that I think might be your destiny
//- and no, I don’t know any specific prophecies, it’s just a guess - involves
//literal descent-into-Hell type stuff.”

// 20060
//“I thought…” Hermione said. She sounded uncertain. “I thought for sure that
//after this, you and Professor McGonagall wouldn’t… you know… let me do anything
//the least bit dangerous ever again.”

// 20061
//Harry said nothing, feeling guilty about the false relationship credit he was
//getting. It was in fact the case that Hermione was modeling him with tremendous
//accuracy, and that if not for Hermione having a horcrux, the surface of the
//planet Venus would have dropped to fractional-Kelvin temperatures before Harry
//tried this.

// 20062
//“On a scale of zero to a hundred, __how__ literal a descent into Hell are
//we talking about here?” said Hermione. The girl now looked a bit worried.

// 20063
//Harry mentally calibrated his scales, remembering Azkaban. “I’d say maybe
//eighty-seven?”

// 20064
//“This sounds like something I should do when I’m __older, __Harry. There’s
//a difference between being a hero and being a complete lunatic.”

// 20065
//Harry shook his head. “I don’t think the risk would change much,” Harry said,
//leaving aside the question of how much risk that really was, “and it’s the sort
//of thing that’s better done sooner, if someone does it at all.”

// 20066
//“And my parents don’t get a vote,” Hermione said. “Or do they?”

// 20067
//Harry shrugged. “We both know how they’d vote, and you can take that into
//account if you like. Um, I said for Dr. and Dr. Granger not to be told yet that
//you’re alive. They’ll find out after you come back from your mission, if you
//choose to accept it. That seems a bit… kinder on your parents’ nerves, they
//just get the one pleasant surprise, instead of having to worry about, um,
//stuff.”

// 20068
//“Why, that’s very thoughtful of you,” Hermione said. “It’s nice that you’re so
//concerned about their feelings. May I think about this for a few minutes,
//please?”

// 20069
//Harry gestured toward the cushion he’d set down opposite his own, and Hermione
//moved over with fluid grace, and sat down to look out over the castle-edge,
//still radiating peacefulness all over the place. They’d really need to do
//something about that, maybe pay someone to invent an Anti-Purity Potion.

// 20070
//“Do I have to decide without knowing what the mission is?” Hermione asked.

// 20071
//“Oh __hell__ no,” Harry said, thinking of a similar conversation before
//his own trip to Azkaban. “This is the sort of thing you have to choose freely
//if you do it at all. I mean that’s an actual mission requirement. If you say
//that you still want to be a hero, I’ll tell you afterwards about the mission -
//after you’ve had some time to eat and talk to people and recover a bit - and
//you’ll decide then if it’s something you want to do. And we’ll test in advance
//whether returning from death has allowed you to cast the spell that normal
//wizards think is impossible, __before__ you go out.”

// 20072
//Hermione nodded, and fell back into silence.

// 20073
//The sky had lightened further by the time Hermione spoke again.

// 20074
//“I’m afraid,” Hermione said, almost in a whisper. “Not of dying again, or not
//__just__ that. I’m afraid I won’t be good enough. I had my chance to
//defeat a troll, and instead I just died -”

// 20075
//“That was a troll empowered by Voldemort as a weapon, plus he sabotaged all
//your magic items, just so you know.”

// 20076
//“I died. And you killed the troll, somehow, I think I remember that part, it
//didn’t even slow you down.” Hermione wasn’t crying, no tears glistened on her
//cheeks, she simply gazed off at the lightening sky where the Sun would rise.
//“And then you brought me back from the dead as a Sparkling Unicorn Princess. I
//__know__ I couldn’t have done that. I’m afraid I’ll __never__ be able
//to do that, no matter what people think about me.”

// 20077
//“This situation is where your journey begins, I think -” Harry paused. “Excuse
//me, I shouldn’t be trying to influence your decision.”

// 20078
//“No,” Hermione whispered, still gazing at the hills below her. She raised her
//voice. “No, Harry, I want to hear this.”

// 20079
//“Okay. Um. I think this is where you __start.__ Everything that’s happened
//up until now… it places you in the same place I started out in September, when
//I’d thought of myself as just being a child prodigy before, and then I found
//something new I needed to live up to. If you weren’t comparing yourself to me
//and my,”__ adult cognitive patterns copied off Tom Riddle,__ “dark side…
//then you’d be the brightest star of Ravenclaw, who organized her own company to
//fight school bullies and kept her sanity under assault by Voldemort, all while
//she was only twelve years old. I looked it up, you got better grades than
//Dumbledore did in __his__ first year.” __Leaving aside the Defense
//grade, because that was just Voldemort being Voldemort.__ “Now you have some
//powers, and a reputation to live up to, and the world is about to hand you some
//difficult tasks. That’s where it all __begins__ for you, the same as it
//began for me. Don’t sell yourself short.” And then Harry shut his mouth hard,
//because he was __talking Hermione into it__ and that wasn’t right. He’d at
//least managed to stop before the part where he asked, if __she__ couldn’t
//be a hero with all that going for her, who exactly she thought was going to do
//it.

// 20080
//“You know,” Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at Harry, “I had a
//conversation like this with Professor Quirrell, once, about being a hero. He
//was taking the other side, of course. But apart from that, this is feeling like
//when he argued with me, somehow.”

// 20081
//Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own decisions was
//hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the __wrong__ ones, but
//it still had to be done.

// 20082
//Hermione spoke carefully, the blue fringes of her Hogwarts uniform now seeming
//brighter against her black robes as the sky all around them became illuminated;
//there were no more stars in the west. “Professor Quirrell told me that time, he
//said that he’d been a hero once. But people weren’t helping him enough, so he
//gave up and went off to do something more interesting. I told Professor
//Quirrell that it hadn’t been right for him to do that - what I actually said
//was ‘that’s horrible’. Professor Quirrell said that, yes, maybe he was an awful
//person, but then what about all the other people who’d never tried to be heroes
//at all? Were they even worse than him? And I didn’t know what to say back. I
//mean, it’s wrong to say that only Gryffindor-style heroes are good people -
//though I think from Professor Quirrell’s perspective it was more like only
//people with big ambitions had a right to breathe. And I didn’t believe that.
//But it also seemed wrong to __stop__ being a hero, to walk away like he’d
//done. So I just stood there looking silly. But now I know what I should’ve told
//him back then.”

// 20083
//Harry controlled his breathing.

// 20084
//Hermione stood up from her cushion, and turned to face Harry. “I’m done with
//trying to be a heroine,” said Hermione Granger with the eastern sky brightening
//around her. “I shouldn’t ever have gone along with that entire line of
//thinking. There are just people who do what they can, whatever they can. And
//there are also people who don’t even try to do what they can, and yes, those
//people are doing something wrong. I’m not ever going to try to be a hero again.
//I’m not going to __think__ in heroic terms if I can help it. But I won’t
//do any less than I can - or not a lot less, I mean, I’m only human.” Harry had
//never understood what was supposed to be mysterious about the Mona Lisa, but if
//he could have taken a picture of Hermione’s resigned/joyous smile just then, he
//had the sense that he could have looked at it for hours without understanding,
//and that Dumbledore could have read through it at a glance. “I won’t learn my
//lesson. I __will__ be that stupid. I’ll go on trying to do most of what I
//can, or at least __some__ of what I can - oh, you know what I mean. Even
//if it means risking my life again, so long as it’s worth the risk and isn’t
//being, you know, __actually__ stupid. That’s my answer.” Hermione took a
//deep breath, but her face was resolute. “So, is there something I can do?”

// 20085
//Harry’s throat was choked. He reached into his pouch, and signed C-L-O-A-K
//since he couldn’t speak, and drew forth the fuliginious spill of the Cloak of
//Invisibility, offering it to Hermione for the last time. Harry had to force the
//words from his throat. “This is the True Cloak of Invisibility,” Harry said in
//almost a whisper, “the Deathly Hallow passed down from Ignotus Peverell to his
//heirs, the Potters. And now to you -”

// 20086
//“Harry!” Hermione said. Her hands flew up across her chest, as though to
//protect herself from the attacking gift. “You don’t have to do this!”

// 20087
//“I __do__ have to do this. I’ve left the part of the path that lets me be
//a hero, I can’t risk myself adventuring, ever. And you… can.” Harry reached up
//the hand that wasn’t holding the Cloak, and wiped at his eyes. “This was made
//for you, I think. For the person you’re going to become.” __A weapon to
//fight Death, in its form as the shadow of despair that falls on human minds and
//drains away their hope for the future; you will fight that, I expect, in more
//forms than just Dementors… __“I do not loan you, my Cloak, but give you, unto
//Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well forevermore.”

// 20088
//Slowly, Hermione reached out, and took hold of the Cloak, looking like she was
//trying not to cry herself. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I think… even though
//I’m done with the notion of heroing… I think that you always were, from the day
//I met you, my mysterious old wizard.”

// 20089
//“And I think,” Harry said, his own throat half-closed, “even if you deny that
//way of thinking now, I think that you were always destined to become, from the
//very beginning of the story, the hero.” __Who must Hermione Granger
//become, what adult form must she take when she grows up, to pass through Time’s
//narrow keyhole? I don’t know the answer to that either, any more than I can
//imagine my own adult self. But her next few steps ahead seem clearer than
//mine…__

// 20090
//Harry let the Cloak go, and it passed from his hands to hers__.__

// 20091
//“It sings,” Hermione said. “It’s singing to me.” She reached up, and wiped at
//her own eyes. “I can’t believe you did that, Harry.”

// 20092
//Harry’s other hand came out of his pouch, now bearing a long golden chain, at
//the end of which dangled a closed golden shell. “And this is your personal time
//machine.”

// 20093
//There was a pause, during which the planet Earth rotated a bit further in its
//orbit, and the True Cloak of Invisibility dropped unnoticed from Hermione’s
//hands and pooled on the roof.

// 20094
//“What?” said Hermione.

// 20095
//“A Time-Turner, they call it. Hogwarts has a stock they give out to some
//students, I got one at the start of the year to treat my sleep disorder. It
//lets the user go backwards in time, in up to six one-hour increments, which I
//used to get six extra hours per day to study. And to vanish out of Potions
//class and so on. Don’t worry, a Time-Turner can’t change history or generate
//paradoxes that destroy the universe.”

// 20096
//“You were keeping up with me in lessons by studying six extra hours per day
//using a __time machine__.” Hermione Granger seemed to be having trouble
//with this concept for some unaccountable reason.

// 20097
//Harry made his face look puzzled. “Is there something odd about that?”

// 20098
//Hermione reached out and took the golden necklace. “I guess __not by
//wizard standards,__” she said. For some reason her voice sounded rather sharp.
//She arranged the chain around her neck, placing the hourglass inside her shirt.
//“I do feel better now about keeping up with you though, so thank you for that.”

// 20099
//Harry cleared his throat. “Also, since Voldemort wiped out the House of Monroe
//and then, so far as everyone believes, you avenged them by killing Voldemort, I
//got Amelia to railroad a bill through what’s left of the Wizengamot, saying
//that Granger is now a Noble House of Britain.”

// 20100
//“Excuse me?” said Hermione.

// 20101
//“That also makes you the only scion of a Noble House, which means that to get
//your legal majority you just need to pass your Ordinary Wizarding Levels, which
//I’ve set us up to do at the end of the summer so we’ll have some time to study
//first. If you’re okay with that, I mean.”

// 20102
//Hermione Granger was making some sort of high-pitched noise that would, in a
//less organic device, have indicated an engine malfunction. “__I have two
//months to study for my O.W.L.S?”__

// 20103
//“Hermione, it’s a test designed so that most fifteen-year-olds can pass.
//__Ordinary__ fifteen year-olds, I mean really. We can get a passing grade
//with a low third-year’s power level if we learn the right set of spells, and
//that’s all we need for our majorities. Though you’ll need to come to terms with
//getting Acceptable scores instead of your usual Outstandings.”

// 20104
//The high-pitched noises coming from Hermione Granger rose in pitch.

// 20105
//“Here’s your wand back.” Harry took it from his pouch. “And your mokeskin
//pouch, I made sure they put back everything that was there when you died.” That
//pouch Harry withdrew from a normal pocket of his robes, since he was reluctant
//to put a __bag of holding__ inside a __bag of holding__ no matter
//what was supposed to be harmless so long as both devices had been crafted
//observing all safety precautions.

// 20106
//Hermione took her wand back, and then her pouch, the motions somehow managing
//to look graceful even though her fingers were a bit shaky.

// 20107
//“Let’s see, what else… the oath you swore before to House Potter only said you
//had to serve until ‘the day you die’, so you’re now free and clear. And right
//after your death I got the Malfoys to publicly declare that you were innocent
//of all charges in Draco’s attempted murder.”

// 20108
//“Why, thank you again, Harry,” said Hermione Granger. “That was very nice of
//you, and them too, I guess.” She was repeatedly running her fingers through her
//chestnut curls, as though, by organizing her hair, she could restore sanity to
//her life.

// 20109
//“Last but not least, I had the goblins start the process of building a vault in
//Gringotts for House Granger,” Harry said. “I didn’t put any money into it,
//because that was something where I could wait and ask you first. But if you’re
//going to be a superhero who goes around righting certain kinds of wrongs, it
//will help a lot if people consider you to be part of the upper social strata
//and, um, I think it may help if they know you can afford lawyers. I can put in
//as much gold into your vault as you want, since after Voldemort killed Nicholas
//Flamel, I ended up holding the Philosopher’s Stone.”

// 20110
//“I feel like I ought to be fainting,” Hermione said in a high-pitched voice,
//“only I can’t because of my superpowers and __why__ do I have those
//again?”

// 20111
//“If it’s all right with you, your Occlumency lessons will start on Wednesday
//with Mr. Bester, he can work with you once per day. Until then, I think it
//might be better for the true origin of your powers not to become known just
//because a Legilimens looks you in the eyes. I mean, obviously there’s a normal
//magical explanation, nothing __super__-supernatural, but people do tend to
//worship their own ignorance and, well, I think the Girl-Who-Revived will be
//more effective if you remain mysterious. Once you can keep out Mr. Bester and
//beat Veritaserum, I’ll tell you the entire backstory, I promise, including all
//the secrets you can never tell anyone else.”

// 20112
//“That sounds lovely,” said Hermione Granger. “I’m quite looking forward to it.”

// 20113
//“Though you’ll need to take an Unbreakable Vow to not do anything that might
//destroy the world before I can tell you the more dangerous parts of the story.
//I mean, I literally can’t tell you otherwise, because I took an Unbreakable Vow
//myself. Is that okay?”

// 20114
//“Sure,” said Hermione. “Why shouldn’t it be okay? I wouldn’t want to destroy
//the world anyhow.”

// 20115
//“Do you need to sit down again?” Harry said, feeling alarmed by the way
//Hermione was swaying slightly, as though in rhythm with the words being spoken.

// 20116
//Hermione Granger took several deep breaths. “No, I’m perfectly peachy,” she
//said. “Is there anything else I should know about?”

// 20117
//“That was it. I’m finished, at least for now.” Harry paused. “I do understand
//that you want to do things for yourself, not just have them done for you. It’s
//just… you’re going to be a more serious kind of hero, and the only sane choice
//is for me to give you all the advantages I can manage -”

// 20118
//“I understand that quite well,” Hermione said. “Now that I’ve actually lost a
//fight and died. I didn’t used to understand, but now I do.” A breeze ruffled
//Hermione’s chestnut hair and stirred her robes, making her look even more
//peaceful in the dawn air, as she raised one hand and carefully clenched it into
//a fist. “If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it __right__. We need to
//measure how hard I can punch, and how high I can jump, and figure out a safe
//way to test if my fingernails can kill Lethifolds like a real unicorn’s horn,
//and I should practice using my speed to dodge spells I can’t let hit me and…
//and it sounds like you could maybe arrange for me to get Auror training, like
//from whoever taught Susan Bones.” Hermione was smiling again now, a strange
//light in her eyes that would’ve puzzled Dumbledore for hours and that Harry
//understood immediately, not without a twinge of apprehension. “Oh! And I want
//to start carrying Muggle weapons, maybe hidden so nobody knows I have them. I
//thought of incendiary grenades when I was fighting the troll, but I knew I
//couldn’t Transfigure them fast enough, even after I stopped caring about
//obeying the rules.”

// 20119
//“I have the feeling,” Harry said, imitating Professor McGonagall’s Scottish
//accent as best he could, “that I ought to be doing something about this.”

// 20120
//“Oh, it’s much, much, MUCH too late for that, Mr. Potter. Say, can you get me a
//bazooka? The rocket launcher, I mean, not the chewing gum? I bet they won’t be
//expecting __that__ from a young girl, especially if I’m radiating an aura
//of innocence and purity.”

// 20121
//“All right,” Harry said calmly, “__now__ you’re starting to scare me.”

// 20122
//Hermione paused from where she was experimenting with balancing on the tip of
//her left shoe, her arm reaching in one direction and her right leg stretched in
//the other, like a ballet dancer. “Am I? I was just thinking that I didn’t see
//what I could do that a Ministry squad of Hit Wizards couldn’t. They have
//broomsticks for mobility and spells that hit harder than I possibly could.” She
//gracefully lowered her leg back down. “I mean, now that I can try a few things
//without worrying about who’s watching, I’m starting to think that I really
//really __really__ like having superpowers. But I still don’t see how I
//could win a fight that Professor Flitwick couldn’t, not unless it involves me
//taking a Dark Wizard by surprise.”

// 20123
//__You can take risks other people shouldn’t, and try again with the
//knowledge of what killed you. You can experiment with new spells, more than
//anyone else could try without dying for sure.__ But Harry couldn’t say any of
//that yet, so instead he said, “I think it’s okay to think more about the
//future, not just what you can do this very minute.”

// 20124
//Hermione jumped high in the air, clicked her heels together three times on the
//way down, and landed on her tiptoes, perfectly posed. “But you said there was
//something I could do right away. Or were you just testing?”

// 20125
//“__That__ part is a special case,” Harry said, feeling the chill of the
//dawn air against his skin. He was increasingly not looking forward to telling
//super-Hermione that her Ordeal would involve facing her literal worst
//nightmare, under conditions where all her newfound physical strength would be
//useless.

// 20126
//Hermione nodded, then glanced to the east. At once she went to the side of the
//roof and sat down, her feet dangling over the rooftop ledge. Harry went to her
//side and sat down too, sitting crosslegged and further back of the roof-edge.

// 20127
//In the distance, a brilliant tinge of red was rising above the hills to the
//east of Hogwarts.

// 20128
//Watching the tip of the sunrise made Harry feel better, somehow. So long as the
//Sun was in the sky, things were still all right on some level, e.g., his having
//not yet destroyed the Sun.

// 20129
//“So,” Hermione said. Her voice rose a bit. “Speaking of the future, Harry. I
//had time to think about a lot of things while I was waiting to be let out of
//St. Mungo’s, and… maybe it’s silly of me, but there’s a question I still want
//to know the answer to. Do you remember the last thing we talked about together?
//Before, I mean?”

// 20130
//“What?” Harry said blankly.

// 20131
//“Oh…” Hermione said. “It was a month ago for you… I guess you don’t recall,
//then.”

// 20132
//And Harry remembered.

// 20133
//“Don’t panic!” Hermione said, as a sort of strangled half-gurgle came from
//Harry’s throat. “I promise no matter what you say, I won’t burst into tears and
//run away and get eaten by a troll again! I know it’s been less than two days
//for me, but I think that dying has made a lot of things I used to fret about
//seem much less important compared to what I’ve been through!”

// 20134
//“Oh,” Harry said, his own voice now high-pitched. “That’s a good use of a major
//trauma, I guess?”

// 20135
//“Only, see, I __was__ still wondering about it, Harry, because for me it
//hasn’t been very long at all since our last conversation, and we didn’t finish
//talking which was admittedly all my own fault for losing control of my emotions
//and then being eaten by a troll which I am definitely not going to do again.
//I’ve been thinking I ought to reassure you that’s not going to happen every
//time you say the wrong thing to a girl.” Hermione was fidgeting, leaning from
//one side to the other where she sat, slightly back and forth. “But, well, even
//most people who __are__ in love don’t do literally one hundredth of what
//you’ve done for me. So, Mr. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, if it’s not love,
//I want to know exactly what I am to you. You never said.”

// 20136
//“That’s a good question,” Harry said in a wobbly voice. “Do you mind if I think
//about it?”

// 20137
//Hermione nodded.

// 20138
//Bit by bit, more of the searingly brilliant circle became visible beyond the
//hills.

// 20139
//“Hermione,” Harry said when the Sun was halfway above the horizon, “did you
//ever invent any hypotheses to explain my mysterious dark side?”

// 20140
//“Just the obvious one,” Hermione said, dangling her legs over the rooftop’s
//edge. “I thought maybe when You-Know-Who died right next to you, he happened to
//give off the burst of magic that makes a ghost, and some of it imprinted on
//your brain instead of the floor. But that never felt right to me, like it was
//just a clever explanation that wasn’t actually __true,__ and it makes even
//less sense if You-Know-Who didn’t really die that night.”

// 20141
//“Good enough,” Harry said. “Let’s imagine that scenario for now.” His inner
//rationalist was looking back and facepalming __again__ at how he’d managed
//to not-think-about hypotheses like that one. It wasn’t true but it was
//__reasonable__ and Harry had never thought of any causal model that
//concrete, just vaguely suspected a connection.

// 20142
//Hermione nodded. “You probably know this already, but I just thought I’d say it
//to be sure: You’re not Voldemort, Harry.”

// 20143
//“I know. And __that’s__ what you mean to me.” Harry took a breath, finding
//it still painful to say aloud. “Voldemort… he wasn’t a happy person. I don’t
//know if he was ever happy, a single day in his life.” __He never could
//cast the Patronus Charm.__ “That’s one reason his cognitive patterns didn’t take
//me over, my dark side didn’t feel like a good place to be, it didn’t get
//positively reinforced. Being friends with you means that my life doesn’t have
//to go the way Voldemort’s did. And I was pretty lonely before Hogwarts,
//although I didn’t realise it then, so… yeah. I might’ve been slightly more
//desperate to bring you back from the dead than the average boy my age would’ve
//been. Though I also maintain that my decision was strictly normative moral
//reasoning, and if other people care less about their friends, that’s their
//problem, not mine.”

// 20144
//“I see,” Hermione said softly. She hesitated. “Harry, don’t take this the wrong
//way, but I’m not one hundred percent comfortable with that. It’s a big
//responsibility that I didn’t choose, and I don’t think it’s healthy for you to
//lay it on just one person.”

// 20145
//Harry nodded. “I know. But there’s more to the point I’m trying to make. There
//was a prophecy about my vanquishing Voldemort -”

// 20146
//“A __prophecy?__ There was a __prophecy__ about you? Seriously,
//Harry?”

// 20147
//“Yeah, I know. Anyway, part of it went, ‘And the Dark Lord shall mark him as
//his equal, but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.’ What would you
//guess that meant?”

// 20148
//“Hmmm,” Hermione said. Her fingers tapped thoughtfully on the stone. “Your
//mysterious dark side is You-Know-Who’s mark on you that made you his equal. The
//power he knew not… was the scientific method, right?”

// 20149
//Harry shook his head. “That’s what I thought too at first - that it was going
//to be Muggle science, or the methods of rationality. But…” Harry exhaled. The
//Sun had now fully risen above the hills. This felt embarrassing to say, but he
//was going to say it anyway. “Professor Snape, who originally heard the prophecy
//- yes, that’s also a thing that happened - Professor Snape said he didn’t think
//it could just be science, that the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ needed to be
//something more alien to Voldemort than just that. Even if I think of it in
//terms of rationality, well, it turns out that the person Voldemort really was,”
//__why, Professor Quirrell, why,__ the thought still stabbing sickness at
//Harry’s heart, “he’d have been able to learn the methods of rationality too, if
//he read the same science papers I did. Except, maybe, for one last thing…”
//Harry drew a breath. “At the end of all of it, during my final showdown with
//Voldemort, he threatened to put my parents, and my friends, into Azkaban.
//Unless I came up with interesting secrets to tell him, one person saved per
//secret. But I knew I couldn’t find enough secrets to save everyone. And in the
//moment that I saw no way at all left to save everyone… that’s when I actually
//started thinking. Maybe for the first time in my life, I started thinking. I
//thought faster than Voldemort, even though he was older than me and smarter,
//because… because I had a __reason to think__. Voldemort had a drive to be
//immortal, he strongly preferred not to die, but that wasn’t a positive desire,
//it was __fear,__ and Voldemort made mistakes because of that fear. I think
//the power that Voldemort knew not… was that I had something to protect.”

// 20150
//“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said gently. She hesitated. “Is that what I am to you,
//then? The thing that you protect?”

// 20151
//“No, I mean, the whole reason I’m telling you this, is that Voldemort wasn’t
//threatening to put __you__ in Azkaban. Even if he’d taken over the whole
//world, you’d have been fine. He’d already made a binding promise not to harm
//you, because of, um, because of reasons. So in my moment of ultimate crisis,
//when I reached deep down and found the power Voldemort knew not, I did it to
//protect everyoneexcept you.”

// 20152
//Hermione considered this, a slow smile spreading over her face. “Why, Harry,”
//she said. “That’s the least romantic thing I’ve ever heard.”

// 20153
//“You’re welcome.”

// 20154
//“No, really, it __does__ help,” Hermione said. “I mean, it makes the whole
//thing much less stalker-y.”

// 20155
//“I know, right?”

// 20156
//The two of them shared a companionable nod, both of them looking more relaxed
//now, and watched the sunrise together.

// 20157
//“I’ve been thinking,” Harry said, his own voice going soft, “about the
//alternate Harry Potter, the person I might have been if Voldemort hadn’t
//attacked my parents.” __If Tom Riddle hadn’t tried to copy himself onto
//me.__ “That other Harry Potter wouldn’t have been as smart, I guess. He probably
//wouldn’t have studied much Muggle science, even if his mother was a Muggleborn.
//But that other Harry Potter would’ve had… the capacity for warmth, that he
//inherited from James Potter and Lily Evans, he would’ve cared about other
//people and tried to save his friends, I know that would have been true, because
//that’s something that Lord Voldemort never did, you see…” Harry’s eyes were
//watering. “So that part must be, the remnant.”

// 20158
//The Sun was well above the horizon now, the golden light illuminating both of
//them, casting long shadows off the other side of the rooftop platform.

// 20159
//“I think you’re just fine the way you are,” Hermione said. “I mean, that other
//Harry Potter might’ve been a nice boy, maybe, but it sounds like I would’ve had
//to do all his thinking for him.”

// 20160
//“Going by heredity, alter-Harry would have been in Gryffindor like his parents,
//and the two of you wouldn’t have become friends. Though James Potter and Lily
//Evans were the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts back in their day, so he
//wouldn’t have been __that__ bad.”

// 20161
//“I can just imagine it,” Hermione said. “Harry James Potter, Sorted into
//Gryffindor, aspiring Quidditch player -”

// 20162
//“No. Just no.”

// 20163
//“Remembered by history as the sidekick of Hermione Jean Granger, who’d send out
//Mr. Potter to get into trouble for her, and then solve the mystery from the
//library by reading books and using her incredible memory.”

// 20164
//“You’re really enjoying this alternate universe, aren’t you.”

// 20165
//“Maybe he’d be best mates with Ron Weasley, the __second__-smartest boy in
//Gryffindor, and they’d fight side by side in my army in Defense class, and
//afterwards help each other with their homework -”

// 20166
//“Okay, enough, this is starting to creep me out.”

// 20167
//“Sorry,” Hermione said, though she was still smiling to herself, appearing rapt
//in some private vision.

// 20168
//“Apology accepted,” Harry said dryly.

// 20169
//The Sun rose a little further in the Sky.

// 20170
//After a while, Hermione spoke. “__Do__ you suppose we’ll fall in love with
//each other later on?”

// 20171
//“I don’t know any better than you do, Hermione. But why does it have to be
//about that? Seriously, why does it always have to be about that? Maybe when
//we’re older we’ll fall in love, and maybe we won’t. Maybe we’ll stay in love,
//and maybe we won’t.” Harry turned his head slightly, the Sun was hot on his
//cheek and he wasn’t wearing sunscreen. “No matter how it goes, we shouldn’t try
//to force our lives into a pattern. I think when people try to __force__
//patterns onto this sort of thing, that’s when they end up unhappy.”

// 20172
//“No forced patterns?” Hermione said. Her eyes had taken on a mischievous look.
//“That sounds like a more complicated way of saying __no rules__. Which I
//guess seems a lot more reasonable to me than it would’ve at the start of this
//year. If I’m going to be a Sparkling Unicorn Princess and have my own time
//machine, I might as well give up on rules, I suppose.”

// 20173
//“I’m not saying that rules are always bad, especially when they actually fit
//people, instead of them being blindly imitated like Quidditch. But weren’t you
//the one who rejected the ‘hero’ pattern in favor of just doing the things she
//could?”

// 20174
//“I suppose so.” Hermione turned her head again to gaze down at the grounds
//below Hogwarts, for the Sun was too bright to look at now - though, Harry
//thought, Hermione’s retinas would regenerate, it was safe for __her__.
//“You said, Harry, that you thought I was always destined to be the hero. I’ve
//been considering, and I suspect you’re completely wrong. If this had been
//__meant__ to be, things would’ve been a lot easier all round. Just doing
//the things you can do - you have to __make__ that happen, you have to
//choose it, over and over again.”

// 20175
//“That might not conflict with your being a destined hero,” Harry said, thinking
//of compatibilist theories of free will, and prophecies that he must not look
//upon in order to fulfill. “But we can talk about that later.”

// 20176
//“You have to choose it,” Hermione repeated. She pushed herself up on her hands,
//then popped herself backwards and onto the rooftop, rising to her feet in a
//smooth motion. “Just like I’m choosing to do this.”

// 20177
//“No kissing!” Harry said, scrambling to his feet and preparing to dodge; though
//the realization came to him that the Girl-Who-Revived would be much, much
//faster.

// 20178
//“I won’t try to kiss you again, Mr. Potter. Not until you ask me, if you ever
//do. But there are all these warm feelings bubbling up inside me and I feel like
//I might burst if I don’t do __something,__ though it does now occur to me
//that it’s unhealthy if girls don’t know any way of expressing gratitude to boys
//besides kissing them.” Hermione took out her wand and offered it crosswise, in
//the position she’d used to swear her oath of fealty to House Potter before the
//Wizengamot.

// 20179
//“Oh __hell__ no,” Harry said. “Do you realise what it took to get you out
//of that oath __last__ time -”

// 20180
//“Don’t go jumping to conclusions, you. I wasn’t about to swear fealty to your
//House again. You’ve got to start trusting me to be sensible if you’re going to
//be my mysterious young wizard. Now please hold out your wand.”

// 20181
//Slowly, Harry took out the Elder Wand and crossed it with Hermione’s
//ten-and-three-quarter-inches of vinewood, forcing down a last worry about her
//choosing the wrong thing. “Can you at least not say anything about ‘until death
//takes me’, because did I mention I have the Philosopher’s Stone now? Or
//anything about ‘the end of the world and its magic’? I’m a lot more nervous
//around phrases like that than I used to be.”

// 20182
//Upon a roof floored in square stony tiles, the brilliant morning Sun blazes
//down upon two not-really-children-anymore, both in blue-fringed black robes,
//facing each other across crossed wands. One has brown eyes beneath chaotic
//chestnut curls, and radiates an aura of strength and beauty that is not magic
//only; the other has green eyes under glasses, with messy black hair above a
//recently inflamed scar. Below, a stone tower nobody remembers seeing from
//ground level stretches downwards into the broad base of the castle Hogwarts.
//Far beneath them are visible the green hills, and the lake. In the distance a
//huge red-and-black line of railcars and an engine, appearing tiny from this
//height, a train neither Muggle nor fully magical. The sky is nearly unclouded,
//but for faint tinges of orange-white where wisps of moisture reflect the
//sunlight. A light breeze carries the crisp chill of dawn, and the dampness of
//morning; but the huge blazing golden globe is now risen high above the horizon,
//and its incandescence casts warmth on everything it touches.

// 20183
//“Well, maybe after this you’ll be less nervous,” the hero says to her enigmatic
//wizard. She knows she doesn’t know the whole story, but the fragment of truth
//that she does hold shines bright like sunlight within her, casting warmth on
//her insides the way the Sun warms her face. “I __do__ choose this, now.”

// 20184
//__Upon my life and magic I swear friendship to Harry Potter,__

// 20185
//__To help him and trust in him,__

// 20186
//__To stand with him and, um, stand by him,__

// 20187
//__And sometimes go where he can’t go,__

//__‘Till the day that death takes me for real, if it ever does, I mean,__
