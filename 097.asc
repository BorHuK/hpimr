//== Roles, Pt 8

// 17061
//For the second time that day, Harry’s eyes filled with tears. Heedless of the
//puzzled eyes of the Ravenclaws in the common room, he reached out to the silver
//creature which Draco Malfoy had sent, cradling it in his arms like a live
//thing; and stumbled off in the direction of his dorm room, heading half-blindly
//for the bottom of his trunk, as the silver snake waited silently in his arms.

// 17062
//__The fifth meeting: 10:12am, Sunday, April 19th.__

// 17063
//The debtor’s meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from Harry Potter, who owed
//Lucius Malfoy a debt of some 58,203 Galleons, was held within the Gringotts
//Central Bank, in accordance with the laws of Britain.

// 17064
//There had been some pushback from Chief Warlock Dumbledore, trying to prevent
//Harry Potter from leaving the security of Hogwarts (a phrase that caused Harry
//Potter to raise his fingers and silently make quote marks in the air). For his
//own part, the Boy-Who-Lived had seemingly pondered quietly, and then assented
//to the meeting, strangely compliant in the face of his enemy’s demand.

// 17065
//The Headmaster of Hogwarts, who acted as Harry Potter’s legal guardian in the
//eyes of magical Britain, had overruled his ward’s assent.

// 17066
//The Debts Committee of the Wizengamot had overruled the Headmaster of Hogwarts.

// 17067
//The Chief Warlock had overruled the Debts Committee.

// 17068
//The Wizengamot had overruled the Chief Warlock.

// 17069
//And so the Boy-Who-Lived had departed under the heavy guard of Mad-Eye Moody
//and an Auror trio for the Gringotts Central Bank; with Moody’s bright-blue eye
//rotating wildly in every direction, as though to signal to any possible
//attacker that he was On Guard and Constantly Vigilant and would cheerfully
//incinerate the kidneys of anyone who sneezed in the general direction of the
//Boy-Who-Lived.

// 17070
//Harry Potter watched more keenly than before, as they marched through the
//wide-open front doors of Gringotts, beneath the motto __Fortius Quo
//Fidelius__. On Harry’s last three visits to Gringotts he had merely admired the
//marble pillars, the gold-burning torchlights, the architecture not quite like
//the human parts of magical Britain. Since then had come the Incident at Azkaban
//and other things; and now, on his fourth visit, Harry was thinking about the
//Goblin Rebellions and goblins’ ongoing resentment at not being allowed to own
//wands and certain facts which hadn’t been in the first-year History textbook,
//which Harry had guessed at by pattern-matching and which Professor Flitwick had
//confirmed in a very quiet voice. Lord Voldemort had killed goblins as well as
//wizards - an incredibly stupid move on Lord Voldemort’s part, unless Harry was
//really missing something - but what goblins thought of the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry
//had no idea. Goblins had a reputation for paying what they owed and taking what
//they thought owed them, along with a reputation for interpreting those accounts
//in a somewhat prejudiced fashion.

// 17071
//Today, the guards standing upright in armor at regular intervals around the
//bank were staring at the Boy-Who-Lived with blank faces, and glaring at Moody
//and the Aurors with flashes of bitter contempt. At the stands and counters of
//the bank’s foyer, goblin tellers stared with equal contempt at the wizards
//whose hands they were filling with Galleons; one teller smiled a sharp-toothed
//grin at a witch who was looking angry and desperate.

// 17072
//__If I understand human nature correctly - and if I’m right that all the
//humanoid magical species are genetically human plus a heritable magical effect
//- then you’re not likely to become friends with a wizard just because I’m
//polite to you, or say that I’m sympathetic. But__ __I wonder if you would
//back the Boy-Who-Lived in a bid to overthrow the Ministry, if I promised to
//revoke the Wand Law afterward… or if I quietly gave you wands, and spellbooks,
//in exchange for your support… is that why the secret of wand-making is
//restricted to people like Ollivander? Though if you really are human, just
//plain human, then the goblin nation probably has its own internal horrors, its
//own Azkabans, for that is also human nature; in which case sooner or later I
//must overthrow or reform your own government as well. Hm.__

// 17073
//An aged goblin appeared before them, and Harry inclined his head with careful
//courtesy, a gesture that the aged goblin returned with an abrupt half-nod.
//There was no wild train ride; instead the aged goblin ushered them into a short
//hallway that terminated in a small waiting room, with three goblin-sized
//benches and one wizard-sized chair, within which nobody sat.

// 17074
//“Do not sign anything that Lucius Malfoy gives you,” Mad-Eye Moody said.
//“__Nothing,__ do you understand me, lad? If Malfoy hands you a copy of
//__The Wonderful Adventures of the Boy-Who-Lived__ and asks you for an
//autograph, tell him that you’ve sprained a finger. Don’t pick up a quill for a
//single second while you’re in Gringotts. If someone hands you a quill, break
//the quill and then break your own fingers. Do I need to explain further, son?”

// 17075
//“Not particularly,” Harry said. “We also have lawyers in Muggle Britain, and
//they’d think your lawyers are cute.”

// 17076
//A short time later Harry Potter handed his wand over to an armored goblin guard
//who frisked him with all manner of interesting-looking probes, and gave his
//pouch to Moody to keep.

// 17077
//And then Harry stepped through another door, and a brief waterfall of Thief’s
//Downfall, which evaporated from his skin as soon as he stepped out.

// 17078
//On the other side of the door was a larger room, richly paneled and appointed,
//with a great golden table stretching across it; two huge leather chairs on one
//side of the table, and a small wooden stool on the other, the debtor’s perch.
//Two goblins in full armor, wearing ornate earpieces and glasses, stood watch
//around the room. Neither side would have wands or any other device of magic,
//and the goblin guards would attack immediately if anyone dared to use wandless
//magic within this peaceable meeting supervised by Gringotts Bank. The ornate
//earpieces would prevent the goblin guards from hearing the conversation unless
//directly addressed, the eyepieces would leave the wizards’ faces as blurs. It
//was, in short, something along the lines of __actual__ security, at least
//if you were an Occlumens.

// 17079
//Harry climbed up onto his uncomfortable wooden stool, thinking __Subtle__
//in a tone of some mental sarcasm, and awaited his creditors.

// 17080
//It was only a brief interval later, much shorter than the time a debtor could
//legally be made to wait, when Lucius Malfoy entered into the room, taking up
//his leather chair with motions worn smooth by practice. His snake-headed cane
//was missing from his hands, his long white mane drifted behind him the same as
//ever, his face could not be read.

// 17081
//Quietly following behind him was a young boy with white-blonde hair, now
//wearing black robes far finer than any Hogwarts uniform, who followed in his
//father’s footsteps with a controlled face. A boy who was also Harry’s creditor
//to the tune of forty Galleons, and also of House Malfoy, and therefore,
//technically, covered by the Wizengamot resolution enabling this meeting.

// 17082
//__Draco.__ Harry didn’t say it aloud, didn’t let his own expression
//change. He could not think of what to say. Not even __I’m sorry__ seemed
//appropriate. Harry hadn’t dared say any of that to Draco’s Patronus either,
//when they had set up this meeting in a few brief exchanges; and not only
//because Lucius might be listening. It had been enough to know that Draco’s
//happy thought was still happy, and that he had still been able to want Harry to
//know it.

// 17083
//Lucius Malfoy spoke first, his voice level, his face set. “I do not understand
//what is happening at Hogwarts, Harry Potter. Would you care to explain it to
//me?”

// 17084
//“I don’t know,” Harry said. “If I understood these events I would not have let
//them happen, Lord Malfoy.”

// 17085
//“Then answer me this question. __Who__ are you?”

// 17086
//Harry gazed evenly at the face of his creditor. “I’m not You-Know-Who, like you
//thought I was,” Harry said. Not being a __complete__ idiot, he’d
//eventually worked out who Lucius Malfoy had thought he was talking to in front
//of the Wizengamot. “Obviously I’m not a normal boy. Equally obviously, that
//probably has __something__ to do with the Boy-Who-Lived business. But I
//don’t know what, or why, any more than you do. I asked the Sorting Hat and it
//didn’t know either.”

// 17087
//Lucius Malfoy nodded distantly. “I could not think of any reason why you would
//pay a hundred thousand Galleons to save a mudblood’s life. No reason save one,
//which would account for her power and bloodthirst alike; but then she died at
//the hands of a troll, and yet you lived. And also my __son__ has told me
//__much__ of you, Harry Potter, which __did not make the tiniest bit
//of sense,__ I have heard the ravings of the mad in St. Mungo’s and they were
//more sensible by far than the events which my __son__ told me under
//__Veritaserum__ that you enacted, and that portion of this __raving
//lunacy,__ which you __personally carried out,__ I would have you explain to
//me, and now.”

// 17088
//Harry turned to look at Draco, who looked back at him with a face that was
//screwing up, being controlled, and then tensing up again.

// 17089
//“I’d also,” Draco Malfoy said in a high and wavering voice, “like, to know,
//why, Potter.”

// 17090
//Harry closed his eyes, and spoke without looking. “A boy raised by Muggles who
//thought he was clever. You saw me, Draco, and you thought of how very useful it
//would be if the Boy-Who-Lived, out of all the other children in your year,
//could be shown the truth of things, if we could be friends. And I thought the
//same thing about you. Only, you and I believed different things were true. Not
//that I’m saying that there are different truths, I mean, there’s different
//beliefs but there’s only one reality, only one universe that can make those
//beliefs true or false -”

// 17091
//“You lied to me.”

// 17092
//Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco. “I would prefer to say,” Harry said,
//not quite with a steady voice, “that the things I told you were true from a
//certain point of view.”

// 17093
//__“A certain point of view?”__ Draco Malfoy looked every bit as angry as
//Luke Skywalker’d had the right to be, and not in a mood to accept Kenobi’s
//excuses, either. “There’s a word for things that are true from a certain point
//of view. They’re called __lies!__”

// 17094
//“Or tricks,” Harry said evenly. “Statements which are technically true but
//which deceive the listener into forming further beliefs which are false. I
//think it’s worth making that distinction. What I told you was a self-fulfilling
//prophecy; you believed that you couldn’t deceive yourself, so you didn’t try.
//The skills you’ve learned are real, and it would have been very bad for you to
//start fighting against them internally. People can’t make themselves believe
//that blue is green by an act of will, but they __think__ they can, and
//that can be almost as bad.”

// 17095
//“You __used__ me,” said Draco Malfoy.

// 17096
//“I only used you in ways that made you stronger. That’s what it means to be
//used by a friend.”

// 17097
//__“Even I know that’s not what friendship is!”__

// 17098
//Now Lucius Malfoy spoke again. “For what purpose? To what end?” Even the elder
//Malfoy’s voice was not quite steady. “__Why?”__

// 17099
//Harry regarded him for a moment, and then turned to Draco. “Your father’s
//probably not going to believe this,” Harry said. “But you, Draco, should be
//able to see that everything which has happened is compatible with this
//hypothesis. And that any more cynical hypothesis wouldn’t explain why I didn’t
//press you harder when you thought I had leverage, or why I taught you so much.
//I thought that the heir of House Malfoy, who’d been publicly seen to grab a
//Muggleborn girl to stop her falling off the roof of Hogwarts, would be a good
//compromise candidate to lead magical Britain after the reformation.”

// 17100
//“So you would have me believe,” Lucius Malfoy said in a thin voice, “that you
//are claiming to be mad. Well, let us leave all that aside. Tell me who set that
//troll on Hogwarts.”

// 17101
//“I don’t know,” Harry said.

// 17102
//“Tell me who you __suspect,__ Harry Potter.”

// 17103
//“I have four suspects. One of them is Professor Snape -”

// 17104
//“__Snape?__” Draco burst out.

// 17105
//“The second, of course, is the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, just because he’s
//the Defense Professor.” Harry would have left him out, not wanting to bring
//Professor Quirrell to the Malfoys’ attention if he was innocent, but Draco
//might have called him on that. “The third, you wouldn’t believe me about. The
//fourth is a catchall category called Everything Else.” __And the fifth,
//Lord Voldemort, I do not think I should name to you.__

// 17106
//Lucius Malfoy’s face contorted in a snarl. “Do you think I cannot recognize
//bait upon your hook? Tell me about this third possibility, Potter, the one you
//wish me to believe is the __true__ answer, and leave aside games.”

// 17107
//Harry regarded Lord Malfoy steadily. “I once read a book I wasn’t supposed to
//read, and it told me this: Communication is an event that takes place between
//equals. Employees lie to their bosses, who, in turn, expect to be lied to. I’m
//not playing coy, I’m observing that it’s simply not possible, in our present
//situation, for me to tell you about the third suspect, and have you believe
//that my story was anything but a lure.”

// 17108
//Draco spoke then. “It’s Father, isn’t it?”

// 17109
//Harry gave Draco a startled look.

// 17110
//Draco spoke evenly. “You suspect that Father sent the troll into Hogwarts to
//get at Granger, don’t you? That’s what you’re thinking, isn’t it!”

// 17111
//Harry opened his mouth to say, __Actually, no,__ and then managed to think
//ahead and stop himself for once in his life.

// 17112
//“I see…” Harry said slowly. “__That’s__ what this is about. Lucius Malfoy
//publicly says that Hermione won’t get away with what she’s done, and lo and
//behold, a troll kills her.” Harry smiled then, in a way that bared his teeth.
//“And if I deny that here, then Draco, who isn’t an Occlumens, can then testify
//under Veritaserum that the Boy-Who-Lived does __not__ suspect Lucius
//Malfoy of having sent a troll into Hogwarts to kill Hermione Granger, sworn to
//the Noble House of Potter, whose blood debt was recently purchased for a
//hundred thousand Galleons et cetera.” Harry leaned back slightly, though his
//wooden stool had no back with which to do it properly. “But now that it’s been
//pointed out, I see that it’s very reasonable. Obviously __you__ killed
//Hermione Granger, just like you threatened to do in front of the whole
//Wizengamot.”

// 17113
//“I did not,” Lucius Malfoy said, expressionless once more.

// 17114
//Harry bared his teeth again in that non-smile. “Well then, in __that__
//case, there must be someone __else__ out there who killed Hermione and
//messed with the Hogwarts wards, the same person who__ earlier __tried
//to__ frame Hermione for Draco Malfoy’s murder.__ Either you killed
//Hermione Granger after being paid for her life, or you blamed your son’s
//attempted murder on an innocent girl and took all my family’s money under false
//pretenses, one of those two things must be true.”

// 17115
//“Perhaps __you__ killed her in hopes of your money being returned.” Lucius
//Malfoy had leaned forward, and was staring hard at Harry.

// 17116
//“Then __I__ would not have given away my money for her in the first place.
//As you already know. Don’t insult my intelligence, Lord Malfoy - no, wait,
//sorry, you just had to __say__ that in case Draco had to testify to it,
//never mind.”

// 17117
//Lucius Malfoy sat back in his chair and stared.

// 17118
//“I tried to tell you, Father,” Draco said under his breath, “but nobody can
//imagine Harry Potter until they’ve actually __met__ him…”

// 17119
//Harry tapped a finger on his cheek. “So people are starting to figure out the
//blatantly obvious? I’m surprised, actually. I wouldn’t have predicted that
//would happen.” Harry had by now caught the general rhythm of Professor
//Quirrell’s cynicism and was able to generate it independently. “I wouldn’t
//think a newspaper would be able to report on a concept like ‘Either X or Y must
//be true, but we don’t know which.’ I would only expect journalists to report
//stories consisting of series of atomic propositions, like ‘X is true’, ‘Y is
//false’, or ‘X is true and Y is false’. Not more complex logical connectors like
//‘If X is true then Y is true, but we don’t know whether X is true’. And all
//your supporters ought to be rapidly switching between ‘You can’t prove that
//Lord Malfoy killed Granger, it could’ve been someone else’ and ‘You can’t prove
//there was someone else to frame Granger’, so long as it’s uncertain they should
//be trying to have it both ways at once… wait, don’t you __own__ the Daily
//Prophet?”

// 17120
//“The Daily Prophet,” Lucius Malfoy said thinly, “which I certainly do not own,
//is far too respectable to publish any such scurrilous nonsense. Unfortunately,
//not all wizards of influence are so reasonable.”

// 17121
//“Ah. Got it.” Harry nodded.

// 17122
//Lucius glanced at Draco. “The rest of what he said - was any of it important?”

// 17123
//“No, Father, it was not.”

// 17124
//“Thank you, son.” Lucius returned his gaze to Harry. His voice, when he spoke,
//was something closer to his usual drawl, cool and confident. “It is possible
//that I could be persuaded to show you some favor, if you admitted before the
//Wizengamot what you clearly know, that I was not responsible for this deed. I
//would be willing to reduce your remaining debt to House Malfoy quite
//significantly, or even adjust the terms to allow later repayment.”

// 17125
//Harry regarded Lucius Malfoy steadily. “Lucius Malfoy. You are now perfectly
//aware that Hermione Granger was, in fact, framed using your son as bait, that
//she was False-Memory-Charmed or worse, and that House Potter held nothing
//against you before that. My counterproposal is that you return my family’s
//money, I announce before the Wizengamot that House Potter holds House Malfoy no
//animus, and we present a united front against whoever’s doing this. We decide
//to screw the roles we’re supposed to play, and ally with each other instead of
//fighting. It could be the one thing the enemy doesn’t expect us to do.”

// 17126
//There was a brief silence in the room, except for the two goblin guards who
//went on breathing regardless.

// 17127
//“You __are__ mad,” Lucius Malfoy said coldly.

// 17128
//“It’s called justice, Lord Malfoy. You cannot possibly expect me to cooperate
//with you while you are holding the wealth of House Potter under what you now
//know to be false pretenses. I understand how it looked to you at the time, but
//you know better now.”

// 17129
//“You have nothing to offer me worth a hundred thousand Galleons.”

// 17130
//“Don’t I?” Harry said distantly. “I wonder. I think it quite probable that you
//care more about the long-term welfare of House Malfoy than about whichever
//political issue the last generation’s failed Dark Lord made his personal
//hobbyhorse.” Harry glanced significantly at Draco. “The next generation is
//drawing its own battle lines and forming new alliances. Your son can be frozen
//out of that, or he can go straight to the top. Is that worth more to you than
//forty thousand Galleons you weren’t particularly expecting and don’t
//particularly need?” Harry smiled thinly. “Forty thousand Galleons. Two million
//Muggle pounds sterling. Your son knows some things about the size of the Muggle
//economy that might surprise you. They’d find it amusing, that the fate of a
//country was revolving around two million pounds sterling. They’d think it was
//cute. And I think much the same, Lord Malfoy. This isn’t about me being
//desperate. This is about you getting a fair chance to be fair.”

// 17131
//“Oh?” said Lord Malfoy. “And if I refuse your fair chance, what then?”

// 17132
//Harry shrugged. “Depends what sort of coalition government gets put together
//without the Malfoys. If the government can be reformed peacefully and it would
//disturb the peace to do otherwise, I’ll pay you the money out of petty cash. Or
//maybe the Death Eaters will be retried for past crimes and executed as a matter
//of justice, as a result of due legal process, of course.”

// 17133
//“You truly are mad,” Lucius Malfoy said quietly. “You have no power, no wealth,
//and yet you say such things to me.”

// 17134
//“Yes, it’s silly to think I could scare you. After all, you’re not a Dementor.”

// 17135
//And Harry went on smiling. He’d looked it up, and apparently a bezoar
//__would__ heal almost any poison if you shoved it into someone’s mouth
//fast enough. Maybe that wouldn’t repair radiation damage from Transfigured
//polonium, but then again, maybe it would. So Harry had looked up the freezing
//points of various acids, and it turned out that sulfuric acid would freeze at
//just ten degrees Celsius, which meant Harry could buy a liter of acid on the
//Muggle market, freeze it solid, and Transfigure it down to a tiny little
//unnoticable water-ice chip to be flipped into someone’s mouth and ingested. No
//bezoar would compensate for that, once the Transfiguration wore off. Harry had
//no intention of saying it out loud, of course, but now that he’d failed
//decisively to prevent any deaths during his quest, he had no further intention
//of being restrained by the law or even the code of Batman.

// 17136
//__Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life was bought
//and paid for the day you committed your first atrocity for the Death Eaters.
//You’re still human and your life still has intrinsic value, but you no longer
//have the deontological protection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed
//to kill you now, if they think it’ll save net lives in the long run; and I will
//conclude as much of you, if you begin to get in my way. Whoever sent the troll
//after Granger must have targeted you too and hit you with some curse that makes
//former Death Eaters melt into a pile of goo. Very sad.__

// 17137
//“Father,” Draco said in a small voice. “I think you should consider it,
//father.”

// 17138
//Lucius Malfoy looked at his son. “You jest.”

// 17139
//“It’s true. I don’t think Potter just made up his books, nobody could have
//written all that and there were things in them that I could check for myself.
//And if even half of all that is true, he’s right, a hundred thousand Galleons
//won’t mean much. If we give it to him he really will be friends with House
//Malfoy again - the way __he__ thinks of being friends, anyway. And if we
//don’t, he’ll be your enemy, whether it’s in his own interests or not, he’ll
//just go after you. Harry Potter really does think like that. It’s not about
//money to him, it’s about what he thinks is honor.”

// 17140
//Harry Potter inclined his head, still smiling.

// 17141
//“But let’s get one part of it straight,” Draco said, now staring directly at
//him. There was a fierce light in his eyes. “__You wronged me. __And
//__you owe me.__”

// 17142
//“Acknowledged,” Harry said quietly. “Conditional on the rest of it, of course.”

// 17143
//Lucius Malfoy opened his mouth to say who-knew-what and then closed it again.
//“Mad,” he said again.

// 17144
//There was a long father-and-son argument during which Harry managed to keep his
//mouth shut.

// 17145
//When it seemed that even Draco wouldn’t be able to persuade his father, Harry
//spoke up again, and proposed his intended next steps, if the Houses of Potter
//and Malfoy could cooperate.

// 17146
//Then came more argument between Lucius and Draco, during which Harry again
//stayed silent.

// 17147
//Finally Lucius Malfoy’s eyes turned to gaze at Harry. “And you believe,” Lucius
//Malfoy said, “that you can persuade Longbottom and Bones to go along with this
//notion, even if Dumbledore opposes it.”

// 17148
//Harry nodded. “They’ll be suspicious of your involvement, of course. But I’ll
//tell them that it was my plan to start with, and that should help.”

// 17149
//“I suppose,” Lucius Malfoy said after a pause, “that I could have a contract
//drawn up, absolving you of __almost__ all the remaining debt, if by some
//chance I do go along with this mad idea. It shall need more guarantees, of
//course -”

// 17150
//Harry promptly reached into his robes and drew out a parchment, unfolding it
//and spreading it across the golden table. “I’ve taken the liberty myself,
//actually,” Harry said. He’d spent some careful hours in the Hogwarts library
//with the law books available. Thankfully, so far as Harry could tell, the laws
//of magical Britain were charmingly simple by Muggle standards. Writing that the
//original blood debt and payment was cancelled, the Potters’ wealth and all
//other vault items would be returned, and the remaining debt annulled, all with
//no fault to the Malfoys, was only a few more lines than it took to say out
//loud. “I had to promise my keepers not to sign anything you gave me. So I made
//sure to compose this myself, and sign it before I left.”

// 17151
//Draco emitted a choked laugh.

// 17152
//Lucius read through the contract, smiling humorlessly. “How charmingly
//straightforward.”

// 17153
//“I also promised not to touch a quill while I was in Gringotts,” Harry said. He
//reached into his robes again and drew out a Muggle pen, along with a sheet of
//normal paper. “Will this wording be all right?” Harry rapidly scribbled down a
//legal-sounding statement to the effect that House Potter didn’t hold House
//Malfoy responsible in any way for Hermione Granger’s murder and didn’t believe
//they had anything to do with it, then held up the paper in the air for Lord
//Malfoy’s inspection.

// 17154
//Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and said, “Good
//enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning, you should use the legal
//term __indemnify__ rather than __exonerate__ -”

// 17155
//“Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord Malfoy.” Harry
//took his parchment and began copying down his original wording more carefully.

// 17156
//When Harry was done, Lord Malfoy reached across the golden table and took the
//pen, looking at it thoughtfully. “One of your Muggle artefacts, I suppose? What
//does this do, son?”

// 17157
//“It writes without needing an inkwell,” Draco answered.

// 17158
//“I can see that. I suppose some might find it an amusing trinket.” Lucius
//smoothed the parchment contract over the table, then set his hand by the line
//for signatures, tapping the pen thoughtfully on the starting spot.

// 17159
//Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy’s face, forcing himself to
//breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his muscles from tensing.

// 17160
//“Our good friend, Severus Snape,” said Lucius Malfoy, still tapping the pen on
//the line awaiting his signature. “The Defense Professor, calling himself
//Quirrell. Now I ask again, who is your third suspect, Harry Potter?”

// 17161
//“I would strongly advise that you sign first, Lord Malfoy, if you’re going to
//do so anyway. You will benefit from this information more if you do not think I
//am trying to persuade you of something.”

// 17162
//Another humorless smile. “I shall take my chances. Speak, if you wish this to
//continue.”

// 17163
//Harry hesitated, then said evenly, “My third suspect is Albus Dumbledore.”

// 17164
//The tapping pen stilled on the parchment. “A strange allegation,” Lucius
//drawled. “Dumbledore lost much face when a Hogwarts student died within his
//tenure. Do you suppose that I will believe anything of him, only because he is
//my enemy?”

// 17165
//“He is one suspect among several, Lord Malfoy, and not necessarily the most
//plausible. But the reason I was able to kill a full-grown mountain troll was
//that I had a weapon which Dumbledore gave to me, at the start of the school
//year. It’s not strong evidence, but it’s suspicious. And if you’re thinking
//that murdering one of his students is not Dumbledore’s style, well, the same
//thought had occurred to me.”

// 17166
//“It’s __not__ his style?” Draco Malfoy said.

// 17167
//Lucius Malfoy shook his head in a measured, careful movement. “Not quite, my
//son. Dumbledore is particular in his evils.” Lord Malfoy leaned back into his
//chair, and then sat quite still. “Tell me of this weapon.”

// 17168
//“I am not yet certain I should go into details about that in your presence,
//Lord Malfoy.” Harry took a breath. “Let __me__ be clear on this. I am not
//trying to sell you on the idea that Dumbledore is behind this, just raising the
//possibility -”

// 17169
//Then Draco Malfoy spoke. “The device Dumbledore gave you - was it something to
//kill trolls? I mean, __just__ trolls? Can you tell us that?”

// 17170
//Lucius turned his head to look at his son with some surprise.

// 17171
//“No…” Harry said slowly. “It wasn’t specifically a sword of anti-troll slaying,
//or anything like that.”

// 17172
//Draco’s eyes were intent. “Would the device have worked against an assassin?”

// 17173
//__Not if they had shields raised.__ “No.”

// 17174
//“A fight in school?”

// 17175
//__An expanding rock in the throat is inherently lethal.__ “No. I don’t
//think it was meant for use against humans.”

// 17176
//Draco nodded. “So just magical creatures. Would it have been a good weapon
//against an angry Hippogriff, or something like that?”

// 17177
//“Does the Stunning Hex work on Hippogriffs?” Harry said slowly.

// 17178
//“I don’t know,” said Draco.

// 17179
//“Yes,” said Lucius Malfoy.

// 17180
//__Compared to trying to target a Wingardium Leviosa and Finite Incantatem
//- __“Then a Stunning Hex would be a better way of dealing with a Hippogriff.”
//Put that way, it did seem increasingly like a Transfigured rock was an optimal
//weapon __only__ against a flesh-and-blood magical creature with
//spell-resistant skin. “But… I mean, it might not have __been__ intended as
//a weapon at all, I used it in a strange way, it could have just been a crazy
//whim -”

// 17181
//“No,” Lucius Malfoy said lowly. “__Not__ a whim. Not coincidence. Not
//Dumbledore.”

// 17182
//“Then it’s him,” Draco said. Slowly Draco’s eyes narrowed, and he gave a
//vicious nod. “It’s been him __since the beginning.__ The court Legilimens
//__said__ that someone had used Legilimency on Granger. Dumbledore
//__admitted__ that it was him. And I bet the wards __did__ go off when
//Granger cursed me and Dumbledore just __ignored__ them.”

// 17183
//“But -” Harry said. He looked at Lucius, wondering if it was really to his
//advantage to question this idea. “What would be his __motive?__ Are we
//going to say he’s evil and leave it at that?”

// 17184
//Draco Malfoy jumped out of his chair and began pacing around the room, black
//robes swishing behind the young boy, the goblin guards staring at him in some
//surprise through their enchanted goggles. “To figure out a strange plot, look
//at what happens, then ask who benefits. Except that Dumbledore didn’t plan on
//you trying to save Granger at her trial, he tried to stop you from doing that.
//What would’ve happened if Granger __had__ gone to Azkaban? House Malfoy
//and House Potter would’ve hated each other forever. Of all the suspects, the
//only one who wants __that__ is Dumbledore. So it fits. It __all__
//fits. The one who really committed the murder is - Albus Dumbledore!”

// 17185
//“Um,” Harry said. “But why give__ me__ an anti-troll weapon? I said it was
//suspicious, I didn’t say that it made any sense.”

// 17186
//Draco nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe Dumbledore thought you’d stop the troll
//before it got Granger and then he could blame Father for sending it. A lot of
//people would be very angry if they thought Father had even __tried__ to do
//something like that, in Hogwarts. Like Father said, Dumbledore must’ve lost
//face when people found out that a student had actually died in Hogwarts, being
//safe is what Hogwarts is famous for. So that part probably wasn’t supposed to
//happen.”

// 17187
//Harry’s mind involuntarily flashed back to the horror in Dumbledore’s eyes when
//he’d seen Hermione Granger’s body.

// 17188
//__Would I have gotten there in time, if the Weasley twins hadn’t had
//their magic map stolen? Could that have been the plan? And then, though
//Dumbledore didn’t know it, somebody stole their map, and I was too late… but
//no, that doesn’t make much sense, I found out too late, how could Dumbledore
//have guessed that I’d use a broomstick… well, he did know I had one…__

// 17189
//There was no way a plan like that could work.

// 17190
//And it hadn’t.

// 17191
//But someone going a little bit senile might __expect__ it to work, and a
//phoenix might not know the difference.

// 17192
//“Or,” Draco Malfoy continued, still pacing energetically, “maybe Dumbledore had
//an enchanted troll around, and he expected you to defeat it some other time,
//for some other plot, and then he used the troll on Granger instead. I can’t
//imagine Dumbledore had this __all__ planned since the first week of
//lessons -”

// 17193
//“I can imagine,” Lucius Malfoy said in low tones. “I have seen such, from
//Dumbledore.”

// 17194
//Draco nodded decisively. “Then I was never __supposed__ to die in the
//first plot. Dumbledore knew Professor Quirrell was checking on me, or
//Dumbledore planned to have someone else find me in time - I couldn’t have
//testified against Granger if I was dead, and he’d have lost face if I’d died.
//But my leaving Hogwarts and not being around to lead Slytherin would be just
//right for him. And then the next time Harry was supposed to stop the troll
//before it got Granger and everyone was supposed to blame you, Father, only that
//time it didn’t go the way Dumbledore planned.”

// 17195
//Lucius Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, from where he’d been gazing with open
//surprise at his son. “If this is true - but I wonder if Harry Potter is only
//playing at being reluctant to believe it.”

// 17196
//“Maybe,” Draco said. “But I’m pretty sure he isn’t.”

// 17197
//“Then, if it is true…” Lucius Malfoy’s voice trailed off. A slow fury was
//lighting in his eyes.

// 17198
//“What __would__ we do, exactly?” Harry said.

// 17199
//“That, too, is clear to me,” Draco said. He whirled on them and raised a finger
//high in the air. “We shall find the proof to convict Dumbledore of this crime,
//and bring him to justice!”

// 17200
//Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy looked at each other.

// 17201
//Neither of them quite knew what to say.

// 17202
//“My son,” Lucius Malfoy said after a time, “truly, you have done very well this
//day.”

// 17203
//“Thank you, Father!”

// 17204
//“However, this is not a play, we are not Aurors, and we do not put our trust in
//trials.”

// 17205
//Some of the light went out of Draco’s eyes. “Oh.”

// 17206
//“I, ah, do have a sentimental fondness for trials,” Harry interjected.
//__I cannot believe I am having this conversation.__ He needed to go home
//and take a sheet of paper and a pencil and try to figure out whether Draco’s
//reasoning __actually__ made sense. “And evidence.”

// 17207
//Lucius Malfoy turned his gaze to Harry Potter then, and his eyes simmered in
//pure grey fury.

// 17208
//“If you have deceived me,” Lucius Malfoy said in tones of low anger, “if all
//this is a lie, then I will not forgive. But if this is not deception… Bring me
//the proof to convict Dumbledore of this murder before the Wizengamot, or
//evidence enough to have him cast down, and there is nothing that House Malfoy
//will not do for you, Harry Potter. Nothing.”

// 17209
//Harry took a deep breath. He needed to sort all this out and figure out the
//actual probabilities, but he didn’t have __time__. “If it __is__
//Dumbledore, then removing him from the gameboard leaves a huge hole in
//Britain’s power structure.”

// 17210
//“So it does,” Lucius Malfoy said with a grim smile. “Did you have ambitions of
//filling it yourself, Harry Potter?”

// 17211
//“Some of your opposition might not like that. They could fight.”

// 17212
//“They will lose,” Lucius Malfoy said, now with a face hard like iron.

// 17213
//“So this is what I’d want House Malfoy to do for me, Lord Malfoy, if Dumbledore
//gets removed because of me. When the opposition is most frightened - that’s
//when they’ll be offered a last-minute arrangement to avoid a civil war. Some of
//your allies might not prefer it, but there’ll be a lot of neutrals who’ll be
//glad to see stability. The bargain will be that instead of you taking over
//right away, Draco Malfoy will take power when he comes of age.”

// 17214
//“__What?__” Draco said.

// 17215
//“Draco has testified under Veritaserum that he tried to help Hermione Granger.
//I bet there’d be a lot of people in the opposition who’d take a chance on him
//rather than fight. I’m not sure how exactly you’d enforce it - Unbreakable Vows
//or Gringotts contracts or what - but there’ll be some sort of enforceable
//compact about power going to Draco after he graduates Hogwarts. I’ll throw any
//support the Boy-Who-Lived has behind that bargain. Try to persuade Longbottom
//and Bones and so on. Our first plan paves the way for that later, if you’re
//careful to act honorable when you deal with Longbottom and Bones this time
//around.”

// 17216
//“Father, I __swear__ I didn’t -”

// 17217
//Lucius’s face twisted into a grim smile. “I know you didn’t, son. Well.” The
//white-haired man stared across the mighty golden table at Harry Potter. “Those
//terms are acceptable to me. But fail in any part of our agreement, whether our
//first bargain, or the second, and there shall be consequences for you, Harry
//Potter. Clever words will not halt that.”

// 17218
//And Lucius Malfoy signed the parchment.

// 17219
//Mad-Eye Moody had been staring at the bronze door of the Gringotts meeting room
//for what seemed like hours, insofar as a man could stare at any one thing when
//his gaze always saw in all directions.

// 17220
//The trouble with trying to be suspicious of a man like Lucius Malfoy, Moody
//thought, was that you could spend an entire day thinking of everything he might
//be up to, and still not have finished.

// 17221
//The door cracked open and Harry Potter trudged out, small beads of sweat still
//on his forehead.

// 17222
//“Did you sign anything?” Mad-Eye demanded upon the instant.

// 17223
//Harry Potter looked at him silently, then reached into his robes and drew out a
//folded parchment. “The goblins are already executing this,” said Harry Potter.
//“They made three copies before I left.”

// 17224
//“MERLIN DAMN IT SON -” Moody paused as his Eye caught sight of the second half
//of the document as Harry Potter slowly, as though reluctantly, began to unfold
//the top upward. A glance sufficed to take in the paragraphs drawn in careful
//handwriting, Lucius Malfoy’s elegant signature below Harry Potter’s. And then
//Moody exploded, even as the top half of the document also began to enter his
//Sight. “You __exonerate House Malfoy__ of __any involvement in
//Hermione Granger’s death? __Do you have any idea what you’ve done, you little
//fool? Why in Merlin’s name would you do something like WHAT -”
