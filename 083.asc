//== Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 1

// 14753
//When Padma entered the Transfiguration classroom, she saw that half the class
//had beaten her there, a strange, deathly silence pervading the room. Harry
//Potter sat alone in one corner, staring off into some unknown distance, his
//eyes half-lidded, nearly closed.

// 14754
//Rumor said that the Aurors had discovered that the Defense Professor had
//Polyjuiced as Granger to fool Malfoy.

// 14755
//Rumor said that Hermione had been bound by the Unbreakable Vow to be Draco
//Malfoy’s slave.

// 14756
//Rumor said that Hermione had gotten the Dementor’s Kiss.

// 14757
//But if __that__ were true, Harry Potter wouldn’t be sitting there, he
//would be -

// 14758
//Padma didn’t know what General Potter would do. Her mind went blank, trying to
//think about it.

// 14759
//Even when Professor McGonagall got there, the silence hadn’t broken. The
//Transfiguration Professor walked up to the board without a pause, erased it
//with a sweep of her hand, and then began to write.

// 14760
//“Today, children,” began the calm professional voice of the Transfiguration
//Professor, just as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened that week,
//“we shall learn how much effort it takes to sustain a Transfiguration, and why,
//at your age, you should not even try. The original Form is not gone, only
//suppressed; and to maintain that suppression -”

// 14761
//“Excuse me,” said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking, she knew that
//she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask. “Excuse me, Professor, what
//happened with Miss Granger?”

// 14762
//The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned to look at Padma.
//The Professor should have looked stern, having been interrupted without a hand
//being raised, but instead her face was kindly. “You don’t already know, Miss
//Patil? I expected that rumor would have spread.”

// 14763
//“There’s too many rumors,” said Padma. “I don’t know what’s true.”

// 14764
//Morag MacDougal raised her hand, then said without waiting to be called, “I
//told you, Padma, what’s __true__ is that the Wizengamot found Granger
//guilty and ordered her to get the Dementor’s Kiss and they brought in the
//Dementor and Harry Potter glued it to the ceiling and wouldn’t let it down
//until -”

// 14765
//“Oh, dear Merlin,” said Professor McGonagall, her expression growing sharp, but
//then she visibly calmed herself. “The affair was utterly ridiculous and I
//shan’t go into detail. Let it stand that Miss Granger is resting with Madam
//Pomfrey for now, and coming back to classes tomorrow. And if I catch anyone
//bothering her, I shall turn them into glass vases and drop them.”

// 14766
//The entire class gasped at this; it wasn’t so much that the threat was fatal,
//as that it broke the safety rules for Transfiguration.

// 14767
//Professor McGonagall turned back to her board -

// 14768
//From a corner of the classroom, another voice rose up. “What about Professor
//Quirrell?” said Terry Boot. “Has he been arrested?”

// 14769
//“The Aurors are only detaining him,” said the Transfiguration Professor without
//turning around. “If they have not given back our Defense Professor by tomorrow,
//I shall ask the Headmaster to go fetch him. Though I may as well tell you now
//that the Board of Governors has scheduled a vote on whether Professor
//Quirrell’s battles shall be allowed to continue.”

// 14770
//Kevin Entwhistle spoke. “And General Malfoy? When’s he getting back from St.
//Mungo’s?”

// 14771
//The Transfiguration Professor paused in her drawing.

// 14772
//She turned around again, more slowly, this time.

// 14773
//“I __am__ sorry, Mr. Entwhistle,” said Professor McGonagall. Her face
//looked a little more lined than when she had entered the room. “Mr. Malfoy’s
//health is in no danger, I am given to understand. Unfortunately, I have
//received an owl from Mr. Malfoy’s father withdrawing him from Hogwarts. I am
//afraid he is not coming back.”
