// 6469
//== Working in Groups, Pt 2

// 6470
//__Aftermaths:__

// 6471
//Harry paced backward and forward in his general’s office, which made a
//wonderful room for pacing, it didn’t have any other uses as far as he could
//tell.

// 6472
//__How?__

// 6473
//__How?__

// 6474
//Hermione shouldn’t have won that battle! Not on her first try, not when she
//wasn’t at all violent by her nature, automatically being a great military
//commander on top of everything else was too much even for __her__.

// 6475
//Had she read about the tactic in a military history book? But it hadn’t been
//just that one tactic, she’d had her forces perfectly positioned to block any
//retreat, her troops had been better coordinated than his __or__ Draco’s…

// 6476
//Had Professor Quirrell broken his promise not to help her? Had he given her the
//diary of General Tacticus or something?

// 6477
//Harry was missing something here, something really important, and his mind went
//around and around in circles, and he still couldn’t figure it out.

// 6478
//Finally Harry sighed. He wasn’t getting anywhere on this, and he had to go
//learn the Breaking Drill Hex from Hermione or someone before the next battle -
//Professor Quirrell had explained to Harry, his voice amused but with a sharp
//undertone of warning, that “no magical items except the ones I give you”
//included Muggle technology no matter how much that __wasn’t magic.__ Plus
//Harry also needed to figure out how to bring down Mr. Goyle next time…

// 6479
//Battles counted for a lot of Quirrell points if you were a general, and Harry
//needed to get cracking if he wanted to win Professor Quirrell’s Christmas wish.

// 6480
//In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into space, as though
//the wall in front of his desk was the most fascinating surface in the world.

// 6481
//__How?__

// 6482
//__How?__

// 6483
//In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning plots went, but
//Granger wasn’t __supposed__ to be cunning! She’d been too much of a
//Hufflepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had Professor Quirrell been advising her
//despite his promise, or…

// 6484
//And then Draco finally did what he should have done much earlier.

// 6485
//What he should have done after the first time he met with Granger.

// 6486
//What Harry Potter had __told__ him to do, __trained__ him to do, and
//yet Harry had also warned Draco that it would take time to make his brain
//realize that the methods applied to real life, and Draco hadn’t
//__understood__ that until today. He could have avoided every single one of
//his mistakes if he’d just __applied __the things Harry had already
//__told __him -

// 6487
//Draco said out loud, “I notice that I am confused.”

// 6488
//__Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by
//fiction than by reality…__

// 6489
//Draco was confused.

// 6490
//Therefore, something he believed was fiction.

// 6491
//Granger should not have been able to do all that.

// 6492
//Therefore, she probably hadn’t.

// 6493
//__I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the two of you
//don’t know about.__

// 6494
//With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the way, hunting
//through the mess on his desk, until he found it.

// 6495
//And there it was.

// 6496
//Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of the three armies.

// 6497
//__Curse__ Professor Quirrell!

// 6498
//Draco had __read__ it and he still hadn’t __seen__ it -

// 6499
//The afternoon sunlight poured down into the office of the Sunshine Regiment,
//illuminating General Granger in her chair as though she glowed with a golden
//aura.

// 6500
//“How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?” said General
//Granger.

// 6501
//“Not long,” said Colonel Blaise Zabini. “He may have already. How long will it
//take Potter to figure it out?”

// 6502
//“Forever,” said General Granger, “unless Malfoy tells him, or one of his own
//soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn’t think like that.”

// 6503
//“Really?” said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of the corner
//tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain Ron Weasley. (They’d
//brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left, of course.) “I mean it
//seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try to come up with all the ideas just
//by themselves?”

// 6504
//“Harry,” said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, “Malfoy.”

// 6505
//“Malfoy thinks he’s way better than everyone else,” said Zabini.

// 6506
//“And Harry… doesn’t really __see__ most other people like that,” said
//Hermione.

// 6507
//It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very alone. It wasn’t
//that he went around thinking in words that only geniuses had a right to exist.
//It just wouldn’t __occur__ to him that anyone in Hermione’s army besides
//Hermione could have any good ideas.

// 6508
//“Anyhow,” Hermione said. “Captains Goldstein and Weasley, you’re on duty for
//thinking up strategic ideas for our next battle. Captains Macmillan and Susan -
//sorry, I mean Macmillan and Bones - try to come up with some tactics we can
//use, also any training you think we should try. Oh, and congratulations on your
//marching song, Captain Goldstein, I think it was a big plus for __esprit
//de corps__.”

// 6509
//“What’re you doing?” said Susan. “And Colonel Zabini?”

// 6510
//Hermione stood up out of her chair, stretching. “I’ll try to figure out what
//Harry Potter is thinking and Colonel Zabini will try to figure out what Draco
//Malfoy might do, and both of us will join you again after we come up with
//something. I’m going to walk while I think. Zabini, you want to come along?”

// 6511
//“Yes, General,” said Zabini stiffly.

// 6512
//It hadn’t been meant as an order. Hermione sighed to herself a little. This was
//going to take some getting used to, and although Zabini’s first idea had
//certainly worked, she wasn’t __quite__ sure that Professor Quirrell’s
//quote mixture of positive and negative incentives unquote would be enough to
//keep the Slytherin fully on her side until December when traitors would be
//allowed for the first time…

// 6513
//She still had no idea what she was going to do with Professor Quirrell’s
//Christmas wish, either. Maybe she’d just ask Mandy if she wanted anything, when
//the time came around.
