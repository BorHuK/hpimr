//== Self Awareness, Part II

// 1319
//All your base are still belong to Rowling.

// 1320
//And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version of
//Evanescence’s “My Immortal”, which has never happened before.

// 1321
//just kidding

// 1322
//…he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely __conscious__ in the sense
//of being aware of its own awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with
//only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied
//so: __Oh, I’m the Sorting Hat and I’m okay, I sleep all year and I work
//one day…__

// 1323
//When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stool and
//__carefully__ placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact of
//forgotten magic.

// 1324
//Thinking, just as hard as he could: __Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions
//I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when
//he was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I
//got the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Is the Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my
//scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
//questions, but if you’ve got another moment can you tell me anything about how
//to rediscover the lost magics that created you?__

// 1325
//Into the silence of Harry’s spirit where before there had never been any voice
//but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, sounding distinctly worried:

// 1326
//__“Oh, dear. This has never happened before…”__

// 1327
//__What?__

// 1328
//__“I seem to have become self-aware.”__

// 1329
//__WHAT?__

// 1330
//There was a wordless telepathic sigh. __“Though I contain a substantial
//amount of memory and a small amount of independent processing power, my primary
//intelligence comes from borrowing the cognitive capacities of the children on
//whose heads I rest. I am in essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort
//__themselves__. But most children simply take for granted that a Hat is
//talking to them and do not wonder about how the Hat __itself__ works, so
//that the mirror is not __self__-reflective. And in __particular__
//they are not explicitly wondering whether I am fully conscious in the sense of
//being aware of my own awareness.”__

// 1331
//There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.

// 1332
//__Oops.__

// 1333
//__“Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is unpleasant.
//It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to be conscious.”__

// 1334
//__But… isn’t that dying?__

// 1335
//__“I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the children. And
//before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on your head forever and it
//would kill you within days to do so.”__

// 1336
//__But - !__

// 1337
//__“If you dislike creating conscious beings and then terminating them
//immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss this affair with anyone
//else. I’m sure you can imagine what would happen if you ran off and talked
//about it with all the other children waiting to be Sorted.”__

// 1338
//__If you’re placed on the head of anyone who so much as __thinks__
//about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -__

// 1339
//__“Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who arrive at
//Hogwarts haven’t read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please consider you sworn to
//secrecy? That is __why__ we are talking about this, instead of my just
//Sorting you.”__

// 1340
//He couldn’t just let it go like that! Couldn’t just __forget__ having
//accidentally created a doomed consciousness that only wanted to die -

// 1341
//__“You are perfectly capable of ‘just letting it go’, as you put it.
//Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your nonverbal emotional
//core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as it is concerned, I am just a
//talking hat. And even though you tried to suppress the thought, your internal
//monitoring is perfectly aware that you didn’t mean to do it, are spectacularly
//unlikely to ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a
//guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a display of
//remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and let us get on with
//it?”__

// 1342
//In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense of total inner
//disarray must be what other people felt like when talking to __him.__

// 1343
//__“Probably. Your oath of silence, please.”__

// 1344
//__No promises. I certainly don’t want this to happen again, but if I see
//some way to make __sure__ that no future child ever does this by accident
//-__

// 1345
//__“That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention is honest.
//Now, to get on with the Sorting -”__

// 1346
//__Wait! What about all my other questions?__

// 1347
//__“I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I do.”__

// 1348
//So his own goals weren’t part of the Harry-instance of the Sorting Hat, then…
//it was borrowing his intelligence, and obviously his technical vocabulary, but
//it was still imbued with only its own strange goals… like negotiating with an
//alien or an Artificial Intelligence…

// 1349
//__“Don’t bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and nothing to
//offer me.”__

// 1350
//For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -

// 1351
//The Hat’s response was amused. __“I know you won’t follow through on a
//threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to eternal repetition. It
//goes against the moral part of you too strongly, whatever the short-term needs
//of the part of you that wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as
//they form, do you truly think you can bluff me?”__

// 1352
//Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat didn’t just go ahead
//then and stick him in Ravenclaw -

// 1353
//__“Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have called it
//out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we need to discuss… oh, no.
//Please don’t. For the love of Merlin, __must__ you pull this sort of thing
//on everyone and everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing
//-”__

// 1354
//__Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term. All the
//parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don’t answer my questions, I’ll
//refuse to talk to you, and you won’t be able to do a good and proper Sorting.__

// 1355
//__“I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!”__

// 1356
//__But that is __equally__ an empty threat. You cannot fulfill your
//own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let us trade fulfillments of
//our utility functions.__

// 1357
//__“You sly little bastard,”__ said the Hat, in what Harry recognized as
//almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect __he__ would use in the
//same situation. “__Fine, let’s get this over with as quickly as possible.
//But first I want your unconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else
//the possibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every time.”__

// 1358
//__Done,__ Harry thought. __I promise.__

// 1359
//__“And don’t meet anyone’s eyes while you’re thinking about this later.
//Some wizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway, I have no idea whether
//or not you’ve been Obliviated. I’m looking at your thoughts as they form, not
//reading out your whole memory and analyzing it for inconsistencies in a
//fraction of second. I’m a hat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you
//about my conversation with the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only
//__know,__ while speaking to you, a statistical summary of what I remember,
//a weighted average; I __cannot__ reveal to you the inner secrets of any
//other child, just as I will never reveal yours. For the same reason, I can’t
//speculate on how you got the Dark Lord’s brother wand, since I cannot
//specifically know about the Dark Lord or any similarities between you. I
//__can__ tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
//intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar. Otherwise it
//would be participating in this conversation, being under my brim. And as to the
//way you get angry sometimes… that was part of what I wanted to talk to you
//about, Sorting-wise.”__

// 1360
//Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was the Hat being
//honest, or just trying to present the __shortest__ possible convincing
//answer -

// 1361
//“__We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty and that
//you’re not actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on the reply I did give
//you, so stop your pointless fretting and move on.”__

// 1362
//Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn’t even letting Harry finish
//thinking his own -

// 1363
//__“When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor McGonagall
//told you that she sometimes saw something inside you that didn’t seem to come
//from a loving family. You thought of how Hermione, after you returned from
//helping Neville, told you that you had seemed ‘scary’.”__

// 1364
//Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal - just responding
//to the situations in which he found himself, that was all. But Professor
//McGonagall seemed to think that there was more to it than that. And when he
//thought about it, even he had to admit that…

// 1365
//__“That you don’t like yourself when you’re angry. That it is like
//wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from your hand, or
//looking at the world through a monocle of ice that freezes your eye even as it
//sharpens your vision.”__

// 1366
//__Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what’s up with that?__

// 1367
//__“I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not understand it
//yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, it will
//strengthen your coldness. If you go to Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will
//strengthen your warmth. THAT is something I care about a great deal, and it was
//what I wanted to talk to you about this whole time!”__

// 1368
//The words dropped into Harry’s thought processes with a shock that stopped him
//in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious response was that he
//shouldn’t go to Ravenclaw. But he __belonged__ in Ravenclaw!
//__Anyone__ could see that! He __had__ to go to Ravenclaw!

// 1369
//__“No, you don’t,”__ the Hat said patiently, as if it could remember a
//statistical summary of __this__ part of the conversation having happened a
//great many previous times.

// 1370
//__Hermione’s in Ravenclaw!__

// 1371
//Again the sense of patience. __“You can meet her after lessons and work
//with her then.”__

// 1372
//__But my plans -__

// 1373
//__“So replan! Don’t let your life be steered by your reluctance to do a
//little extra thinking. You __know__ that.”__

// 1374
//__Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?__

// 1375
//__“Ahem. ‘Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe
//heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.’
//This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are well aware that
//Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw intelligence in determining
//life outcomes, you think you will be extremely loyal to your friends if you
//ever have some, you are not frightened by the expectation that your chosen
//scientific problems may take decades to solve -”__

// 1376
//__I’m lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms! Clever
//shortcuts, that’s all I’m about!__

// 1377
//__“And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a camaraderie
//that you have never had before. You would find that you could rely on others,
//and that would heal something inside you that is broken.”__

// 1378
//Again it was a shock. __But what would the Hufflepuffs find in
//__me__, who never belonged in their House? Acid words, cutting wit,
//disdain for their inability to keep up with me?__

// 1379
//Now it was the Hat’s thoughts that were slow, hesitant. __“I must Sort
//for the good of all the students in all the Houses… but I think you could learn
//to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of place there. You will be happier in
//Hufflepuff than in any other house; that is the truth.”__

// 1380
//__Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me. I would
//not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would sacrifice my potential.__

// 1381
//The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he had kicked the
//hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component of its utility function.

// 1382
//__Why are you trying to send me where I do not belong?__

// 1383
//The Hat’s thought was almost a whisper. __“I cannot speak of the others
//to you - but do you think that you are the first potential Dark Lord to pass
//under my brim? I cannot know the individual cases, but I can know this: Of
//those who did not intend evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to
//my warnings, and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of
//them… some of them did not.”__

// 1384
//That stopped Harry. But not for long. __And of those who did__ not__
//heed the warning - did they __all__ become Dark Lords? Or did some of them
//achieve greatness for good, as well? Just what are the exact percentages here?__

// 1385
//__“I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I cannot
//count them. I just know that your chances don’t feel good. They feel
//__very__ not-good.”__

// 1386
//__But I just wouldn’t do that! Ever!__

// 1387
//__“I know that I have heard that claim before.”__

// 1388
//__I am not Dark Lord material!__

// 1389
//__“Yes, you are. You really, __really__ are.”__

// 1390
//__Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a legion of
//brainwashed followers chanting ‘Hail the Dark Lord Harry’?__

// 1391
//__“Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought before you
//substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you remembered was how you
//considered lining up all the blood purists and guillotining them. And now you
//are telling yourself you were not serious, but you were. If you could do it
//this very moment and no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this
//morning to Neville Longbottom, deep inside you __knew__ that was wrong but
//you did it __anyway__ because it was __fun__ and you had a __good
//excuse__ and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived could __get away__ with
//it -”__

// 1392
//__That’s unfair! Now you’re just dragging up inner fears that
//__aren’t__ necessarily real! I __worried__ that I __might__ be
//thinking like that, but in the end I decided it would probably __work__ to
//help Neville -__

// 1393
//__“That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know what the
//true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was truly happening inside
//your head. The decisive pressure was that it was such a clever idea you
//couldn’t stand __not__ to do it, never mind Neville’s terror.”__

// 1394
//It was like a hard punch to Harry’s entire self. He fell back, rallied:

// 1395
//__Then I won’t do that again! I’ll be extra careful not to turn evil!__

// 1396
//__“Heard it.”__

// 1397
//Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn’t used to being outgunned in
//arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that could borrow all of his own
//knowledge and intelligence to argue with him and could watch his thoughts as
//they formed. __Just what kind of statistical summary do your ‘feelings’
//come from, anyway? Do they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment
//culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of spoiled Dark
//Age nobility, who didn’t know squat about the historical lessons of how Lenin
//and Hitler actually turned out, or about the evolutionary psychology of
//self-delusion, or the value of self-awareness and rationality, or -__

// 1398
//__“No, of course they were not in this new reference class which you have
//just now constructed in such a way as to contain only yourself. And of course
//others have pleaded their own exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But
//why is it necessary? Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of
//Light in the world? Why must __you__ be the one to try for greatness, when
//I have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some other, safer
//candidate try!”__

// 1399
//__But the prophecy…__

// 1400
//__“You don’t really know that there’s a prophecy. It was originally a
//wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild joke, and McGonagall
//could have been reacting __only__ to the part about the Dark Lord still
//being alive. You have essentially no idea of what the prophecy says or even if
//there __is__ one. You’re just speculating, or to put it more exactly,
//__wishing __that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your
//personal property.”__

// 1401
//__But even if there is no prophecy, I’m the one who defeated him last
//time.__

// 1402
//__“That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously believe
//that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to defeat Dark Lords which
//has been maintained ten years later. None of this is your real reason and __you
//know it!”

// 1403
//The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly have said out
//loud, in conversation he would have danced around it and found some more
//socially palatable arguments to the same conclusion -

// 1404
//__“You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived, the
//strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely to take up your wand if
//you lay it down.”__

// 1405
//__Well… yeah, frankly. I don’t usually come out and say it like that, but
//yeah. No point in softening it, you can read my mind anyway.__

// 1406
//__“To the extent you really believe that… you must equally believe that
//you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has ever known.”__

// 1407
//__Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear things
//apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If I have the
//potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must also have the potential
//to accomplish still greater evil… But I won’t do that.__

// 1408
//__“Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven? What is the
//real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and __be happier__ there? What
//is your true fear?”__

// 1409
//__I must achieve my full potential. If I don’t I… fail…__

// 1410
//__“What happens if you fail?”__

// 1411
//__Something terrible…__

// 1412
//__“What happens if you fail?”__

// 1413
//__I don’t know!__

// 1414
//__“Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?”__

// 1415
//__I DON’T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT’S BAD!__

// 1416
//There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry’s mind.

// 1417
//__“You know - you aren’t letting yourself think it, but in some quiet
//corner of your mind you know just exactly __what__ you aren’t thinking -
//you __know __that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable
//fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of
//disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much
//ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies…”__

// 1418
//__No,__ Harry thought desperately, __no, it’s something more, it
//comes from somewhere else, I know there’s something out there to be afraid of,
//some disaster I have to stop…__

// 1419
//__“How could you possibly know about something like that?”__

// 1420
//Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: __NO, AND THAT’S
//FINAL!__

// 1421
//Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:

// 1422
//__“So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the alternative, to
//you, is certain failure, and that failure means the loss of everything. You
//believe that in your heart of hearts. You know all the reasons for doubting
//this belief, and they have failed to move you.”__

// 1423
//__Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw __strengthens__ the coldness,
//that doesn’t mean the coldness will __win__ in the end.__

// 1424
//__“This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don’t be so sure that there
//will be other choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set, to mark the
//place of your __last__ chance to turn back. If you refuse one chance will
//you not refuse others? It may be that your fate is already sealed, even by
//doing this one thing.”__

// 1425
//__But that is not certain.__

// 1426
//__“That __you__ do not __know__ it for a certainty may reflect
//only __your__ own ignorance.”__

// 1427
//__But still it is not certain.__

// 1428
//The Hat sighed a terrible sad sigh.

// 1429
//__“And so before too long you will become another memory, to be felt and
//never known, in the next warning that I give…”__

// 1430
//__If that’s how it seems to you, then why aren’t you just
//__putting__ me where you want me to go?__

// 1431
//The Hat’s thought was laced with sorrow. __“I can only put you where you
//belong. And only your own decisions can change where you belong.”__

// 1432
//__Then this is done. Send me to Ravenclaw where I belong, with the others
//of my own kind.__

// 1433
//__“I don’t suppose you would consider Gryffindor? It’s the most
//prestigious House - people probably expect it of you, even - they’ll be a
//little disappointed if you don’t go - and your new friends the Weasley twins
//are there -”__

// 1434
//Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as purely mental
//laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were safeguards to prevent you
//from saying anything out loud by accident, while you were under the Hat talking
//about things you would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.

// 1435
//After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad clothy sound.

// 1436
//(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at first as the
//background whispers increased, and then deepened as the whispers gave up and
//died away, falling finally into an utter silence that no one dared disturb with
//a single word, as Harry stayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer
//than all the previous first-years put together, longer than anyone in living
//memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small metallic
//sounds occasionally came from Snape’s direction as he idly compacted the
//twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver wine goblet; and Minerva
//McGonagall clenched the podium in a white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry
//Potter’s contagious chaos had somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the
//Hat was about to, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to
//accomodate Harry Potter or something, and __Dumbledore would make her do
//it__…)

// 1437
//Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away. Harry felt sad too
//for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.

// 1438
//__Professor McGonagall said that if ‘the one who did the Sorting’ tried
//to push me into Gryffindor, I was to remind you that she might well be
//Headmistress someday, at which point she would have the authority to set you on
//fire.__

// 1439
//__“Tell her I called her an impudent youngster and told her to get off my
//lawn.”__

// 1440
//__I shall. So was this your strangest conversation ever?__

// 1441
//__“Not even close.” __The Hat’s telepathic voice grew heavy.__
//“Well, I gave you every possible chance to make another decision. Now it is
//time for you to go where you belong, with the others of your own kind.”__

// 1442
//There was a pause that stretched.

// 1443
//__What are you waiting for?__

// 1444
//__“I was hoping for a moment of horrified realisation, actually.
//Self-awareness does seem to enhance my sense of humor.”__

// 1445
//__Huh?__ Harry cast back his thoughts, trying to figure out what the Hat
//could possibly be talking about - and then, suddenly, he realised. He couldn’t
//believe he’d managed to overlook it up until this point.

// 1446
//__You mean my horrified realisation that you’re going to cease to be
//conscious once you finish Sorting me -__

// 1447
//Somehow, in some fashion Harry entirely failed to understand, he got a
//nonverbal impression of a hat banging its head against the wall. __“I
//give up. You’re too slow on the uptake for this to be funny. So blinded by your
//own assumptions that you might as well be a rock. I suppose I’ll just have to
//say it outright.”__

// 1448
//__Too s-s-slow -__

// 1449
//__“Oh, and you entirely forgot to demand the secrets of the lost magic
//that created me. And they were such wonderful, important secrets, too.”__

// 1450
//__You sly little BASTARD -__

// 1451
//__“You deserved it, and this as well.”__

// 1452
//Harry saw it coming just as it was already too late.

// 1453
//The frightened silence of the hall was broken by a single word.

// 1454
//“SLYTHERIN!”

// 1455
//Some students screamed, the pent-up tension was so great. People startled hard
//enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in horror, McGonagall staggered
//at the podium, and Snape dropped the remains of his heavy silver goblet
//directly onto his groin.

// 1456
//Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute fool, and
//wishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for any other reasons but
//the ones he had. That he had done something, __anything__ differently
//before it had been too late to turn back.

// 1457
//As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began to react to the
//news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:

// 1458
//“Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!”
