//== Coordination Problems, Pt 1

// 6555
//I just recite to myself, over and over, until I can choose sleep: It all adds
//up to J. K. Rowling.

// 6556
//The version of decision theory used in this chapter is __not__ the
//academically dominant one. It’s based on something called “timeless decision
//theory” that’s under development by (among others) Gary Drescher, Wei Dai,
//Vladimir Nesov, and, well… __(coughs a few times)__ me.

// 6557
//The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.

// 6558
//“Albus,” Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of her voice as
//the two of them entered the Great Hall, “something has to be done.”

// 6559
//The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright and cheerful. The
//Great Hall had already been decorated in green and red, after a Slytherin and a
//Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had become a symbol of friendship transcending
//Houses and allegiances, a tradition almost as ancient as Hogwarts itself and
//which had even spread to Muggle countries.

// 6560
//Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over their shoulders, or
//sending vicious glares at other tables, or at some tables arguing heatedly. You
//could have described the atmosphere as __tense,__ perhaps, but the phrase
//coming to Minerva’s mind was __fifth degree of caution.__

// 6561
//Take a school, into four Houses divided…

// 6562
//Now into each year, add three armies at war.

// 6563
//And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spread beyond the
//first-years; they had become the armies for those who had no armies. Students
//were wearing armbands with insignia of fire or smile or upraised hand, and
//hexing each other in the corridors. All three first-year generals had told them
//to stop - even Draco Malfoy had heard her out and then nodded grimly - but
//their supposed followers hadn’t listened.

// 6564
//Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. “__In every
//city,__” the old wizard quoted softly,”__the population has been divided
//for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions…__ __And they
//fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves…
//____So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which
//has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place
//neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the
//case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be
//brothers or any other kin. I, for my part, am unable to call this anything
//except a disease of the soul…__“

// 6565
//“I’m sorry,” said Minerva, “I don’t -”

// 6566
//“Procopius,” said Dumbledore. “They took their chariot-racing very seriously,
//in the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that something must be done.”

// 6567
//“Soon,” Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. “Albus, I think it must
//be done before Saturday.”

// 6568
//On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the holiday with their
//families; Saturday, then, was the final battle of the three first-year armies
//that would determine the awarding of Professor Quirrell’s thrice-cursed
//Christmas wish.

// 6569
//Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. “You fear that the
//explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt.”

// 6570
//Minerva nodded.

// 6571
//“And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed.”

// 6572
//Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since become wise in the
//ways that Defense Professors were fired. “Albus,” Minerva said, “we cannot lose
//Professor Quirrell now, we __cannot!__ If he but stays through January our
//fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years
//will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months, a whole
//generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of the Dark Lord’s
//curse - you must stop the battle, Albus! Ban the armies now!”

// 6573
//“I am not sure the Defense Professor would take that kindly,” said Dumbledore,
//glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell was drooling into his soup.
//“He did seem most attached to his armies, though when I agreed I thought there
//would be four in each year.” The old wizard sighed. “A clever man, probably
//with the best of intentions; but perhaps not clever enough, I fear. And to ban
//the armies might also trigger the explosion.”

// 6574
//“But then Albus, what will you __do?__”

// 6575
//The old wizard favored her with a benign smile. “Why, I shall plot, of course.
//It’s the new fashion in Hogwarts.”

// 6576
//And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say anything more.

// 6577
//The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.

// 6578
//The first battle in December had been… messy, or so Draco had heard.

// 6579
//The second battle had been __deranged__.

// 6580
//And the next one would be __worse__, unless the three of them together
//succeeded in their last desperate attempt to stop it.

// 6581
//“Professor Quirrell, this is insanity,” Draco said flatly. “This isn’t
//Slytherin any more, it’s just…” Draco was at a loss for words. He waved his
//hands helplessly. “You can’t possibly do any real plots with all this stuff
//going on. Last battle, one of my soldiers faked his own suicide. We have
//__Hufflepuffs__ trying to plot, and they think they can, but they
//__can’t.__ Things just happen at random now, it doesn’t have anything to
//do with who’s cleverest, or which army fights best, it’s…” He couldn’t even
//describe it.

// 6582
//“I agree with Mr. Malfoy,” said Granger in the tones of someone who hadn’t ever
//expected to hear herself saying those words. “Allowing traitors isn’t working,
//Professor Quirrell.”

// 6583
//Draco had tried forbidding anyone in his army to plot except him, and that had
//just driven the plots underground, no one wanted to be left out when the
//soldiers in __other__ armies got to plot. After miserably losing their
//last battle, he’d finally given in and revoked his decree; but by then his
//soldiers had already started setting their own personal plans in motion,
//without any sort of central coordination.

// 6584
//After being told all the plans, or what his soldiers claimed were their plans,
//Draco had tried to sketch a plot to win the final battle. It had required
//considerably more than three different things to go right, and Draco had used
//__Incendio__ on the paper and __Everto__ to vanish the ashes, because
//if Father had seen it he would have been disowned.

// 6585
//Professor Quirrell’s eyelids were half-closed, his chin resting on his hands as
//he leaned forward onto his desk. “And you, Mr. Potter?” said the Defense
//Professor. “Are you likewise in agreement?”

// 6586
//“All we’d need to do is shoot Franz Ferdinand and we could start World War
//One,” said Harry. “It’s gone to complete chaos. I’m all for it.”

// 6587
//“__Harry!__” said Draco in utter shock.

// 6588
//He didn’t even realize until a second later that he’d said it at exactly the
//same time, and in exactly the same tone of indignation, as Granger.

// 6589
//Granger shot him a startled glance, and Draco carefully kept his face neutral.
//Oops.

// 6590
//“That’s right!” said Harry. “I’m betraying you! Both of you! Again! Ha ha!”

// 6591
//Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly, though his eyes were still half-closed.
//“And why is that, Mr. Potter?”

// 6592
//“Because I think I can cope with the chaos better than Miss Granger or Mr.
//Malfoy,” said the traitor. “Our war is a zero-sum game, and it doesn’t matter
//whether it’s easy or hard in an absolute sense, only who does better or worse.”

// 6593
//Harry Potter was learning far too fast.

// 6594
//Professor Quirrell’s eyes moved beneath their lids to regard Draco, and then
//Granger. “In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I simply could not live with
//myself if I shut down the grand debacle before its climax. One of your soldiers
//has even become a quadruple agent.”

// 6595
//“__Quadruple?__” said Granger. “But there’s only three sides in the war!”

// 6596
//“Yes,” said Professor Quirrell, “you’d think that, wouldn’t you. I am not sure
//that there has ever in history been a quadruple agent, or any army with such a
//high fraction of real and pretended traitors. We are exploring new realms, Miss
//Granger, and we cannot turn back now.”

// 6597
//Draco left the Defense Professor’s office with his teeth gritting hard against
//each other, and Granger looking even more annoyed beside him.

// 6598
//“I can’t believe you did that, Harry!” said Granger.

// 6599
//“Sorry,” Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved up in a merry
//smile of evil. “Remember, Hermione, it __is__ just a game, and why should
//generals like us be the only ones who get to plot? And besides, what are the
//two of you going to do about it? Team up against me?”

// 6600
//Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was as tight as
//hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and gloatingly, on Draco’s
//refusal to make common cause with a mudblood girl; and Draco was beginning to
//get __sick__ of having that used against him. If this kept up much longer
//he __was__ going to ally with Granger just to crush Harry Potter, and see
//how much the son of a mudblood liked __that.__

// 6601
//The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.

// 6602
//Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling utterly and
//completely helpless.

// 6603
//There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names, and some of
//the lines were in different colors and…

// 6604
//“Tell me,” said General Granger, “is there anyone in my army who __isn’t__
//a spy?”

// 6605
//The two of them weren’t in the office but in another, deserted classroom, and
//they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said, it was now nearly certain
//that at least one of the captains was a traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein,
//but Zabini didn’t know for sure.

// 6606
//Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin’s face. Blaise
//Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but he didn’t seem to actively
//dislike her; nothing like the derision he held for Draco Malfoy, or the
//resentment he had developed for Harry Potter. She had worried at first about
//Zabini betraying her, but the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two
//generals were no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini would
//probably be happy to sell her out to anyone __else__, he’d never let
//Malfoy or Harry win.

// 6607
//“Most of your soldiers __are__ still loyal to you, I’m pretty sure,” said
//Zabini. “It’s just that no one wants to be left out of the fun.” The scornful
//look on the Slytherin’s face made it clear what he thought of people who didn’t
//take plotting seriously. “So they think they can be double agents and secretly
//work for our side while pretending to betray us.”

// 6608
//“And that would also go for anyone in the __other__ armies who says they
//want to be __our__ spy,” Hermione said carefully.

// 6609
//The young Slytherin shrugged. “I think I did a good job of telling which ones
//really want to sell out Malfoy, I’m not sure __anyone__ really wants to
//sell out Potter to you. But Nott is a sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy
//and since I had Entwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and
//Entwhistle really reports to us, that’s almost as good -”

// 6610
//Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “We’re going to lose, aren’t we?”

// 6611
//“Look,” Zabini said patiently, “You’re in the lead right now on Quirrell
//points. We just have to not lose this last battle __completely__ and
//you’ll have enough Quirrell points to win the Christmas wish.”

// 6612
//Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would operate on a
//formal scoring system, which he’d been asked to do to avoid recriminations
//afterward. Each time you shot someone, the general of your army got two
//Quirrell points. A gong would ring through the battle area (they didn’t know
//yet where they would be fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest
//again, where Sunshine did well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the
//points. And if anyone was faking being hit, the gong would ring out anyway, and
//then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed time, to hail the
//retraction. And if you called the name of an army, cried “For Sunshine!” or
//“For Chaos!” or “For Dragon!”, it switched your allegiance to that army…

// 6613
//Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in __that__ set of rules. But
//Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if you’d been originally
//assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you in the name of Sunshine - or
//rather, they could, but then Sunshine lost a single Quirrell point, symbolized
//by a triple gong. That prevented you from shooting your own soldiers for
//points, and discouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, but you could still
//shoot spies if you had to.

// 6614
//Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell points, and Malfoy
//had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two hundred and twenty-one; and
//there were twenty-four soldiers in each army.

// 6615
//“So we fight carefully,” Hermione said, “and just try not to lose too badly.”

// 6616
//“No,” said Zabini. The young Slytherin’s face was now serious. “The problem is,
//Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to win is to combine and crush
//us, then fight it out on their own. So here’s what I think we should do -”

// 6617
//Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini’s plan hadn’t been
//the obvious one, it had been strange and complicated and layered and the sort
//of thing she would’ve expected Harry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong
//just for her to be able to __understand__ a plan like that. Young girls
//shouldn’t be able to understand plans like that. The Hat would’ve Sorted her
//into Slytherin, if it’d seen that she could understand plans like that…

// 6618
//The awesome thing was how fast he’d been able to escalate the chaos once he
//started doing it deliberately.

// 6619
//Harry sat in his office; he’d been given the authority to order furniture from
//the house elves, so he’d ordered a throne, and curtains in a black and crimson
//pattern. Scarlet light like blood, mixed with shadow, poured over the floor.

// 6620
//Something in Harry felt like he’d finally come home.

// 6621
//Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted minions, one
//of whom was a traitor.

// 6622
//This. This was what life should be like.

// 6623
//“We are gathered,” said Harry.

// 6624
//“Let Chaos reign,” chorused his four Lieutenants.

// 6625
//“My hovercraft is full of eels,” said Harry.

// 6626
//“I will not buy this record, it is scratched,” chorused his four Lieutenants.

// 6627
//“All mimsy were the borogroves.”

// 6628
//“And the mome raths outgrabe!”

// 6629
//That concluded the formalities.

// 6630
//“How goes the confusion?” Harry said in a dry whisper like Emperor Palpatine.

// 6631
//“It goes well, General Chaos,” said Neville in the tone he always used for
//military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often had to stop and cough. The
//Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in his black school robes, trimmed in the
//yellow of Hufflepuff House, and his hair was parted and combed in the usual
//look for an earnest young boy. Harry had liked the incongruity better than any
//of the cloaks they’d tried. “Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots since
//yesterday evening.”

// 6632
//Harry smiled evilly. “Do any of them have a chance of working?”

// 6633
//“I don’t think so,” said Neville of Chaos. “Here’s the report.”

// 6634
//“Excellent,” said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the parchment from
//Neville’s hand, trying his best to make it sound like he was choking on dust.
//That brought the total to sixty.

// 6635
//Let Draco __try__ to handle that. Let him __try__.

// 6636
//And as for Blaise Zabini…

// 6637
//Harry laughed again, and this time it didn’t even take an effort to sound evil.
//He really needed to borrow someone’s pet Kneazle for his staff meetings, so
//he’d have a cat to stroke while he did this.

// 6638
//“Can the Legion stop making plots now?” said Finnigan of Chaos. “I mean, don’t
//we have enough already -”

// 6639
//“No,” Harry said flatly. “We can __never__ have enough plots.”

// 6640
//Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the boundaries
//further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and Harry wouldn’t have been
//able to live with himself if he’d turned back now.

// 6641
//There came a knock at the door.

// 6642
//“That will be the Dragon General,” Harry said, smiling with evil prescience.
//“He arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in, and yourselves out.”

// 6643
//And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark looks at Draco as
//the enemy general entered into Harry’s secret lair.

// 6644
//If he wasn’t allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was just going to stay
//eleven forever.

// 6645
//The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of blood dancing
//across the floor from behind Harry Potter’s grownup-sized cushioned chair,
//which he had covered in gold and silver glitter and insisted on referring to as
//his throne.

// 6646
//(Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he’d done the right
//thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he could take over the
//world. Draco couldn’t even __imagine__ what it would be like to live under
//his rule.)

// 6647
//“Good evening, Dragon General,” said Harry Potter in a chill whisper. “You have
//arrived just as I expected.”

// 6648
//This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had agreed on the
//meeting time in advance.

// 6649
//And it also wasn’t evening, but by now Draco knew better than to say anything.

// 6650
//“General Potter,” Draco said with as much dignity as he could manage, “you know
//that our two armies have to work together for __either__ of us to win
//Professor Quirrell’s wish, right?”

// 6651
//“Yesss,” hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a Parselmouth. “We must
//cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then fight it out between us. But if
//one of us betrays the other earlier on, that one could gain an advantage in the
//later fight. And the Sunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick
//each of us into thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know
//that, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is Granger’s
//trickery. And Granger knows __that__, as well.”

// 6652
//Draco nodded. That much was obvious. “And… both of us __only__ want to
//win, and there’s no one else who’ll punish either of us if we defect…”

// 6653
//“Precisely,” said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious. “We are faced
//with a __true__ Prisoner’s Dilemma.”

// 6654
//The Prisoner’s Dilemma, according to Harry’s teachings, ran thus: Two prisoners
//had been locked in separate cells. There was evidence against each prisoner,
//but only minor evidence, enough for a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each
//prisoner could opt to __defect,__ betray the other, testify against them
//in court; and this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add
//two years to the other’s. Or a prisoner could __cooperate,__ staying
//silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying against the other, they
//would serve three years apiece; if both cooperated, or stayed silent, they
//would serve two years each; but if one defected and the other cooperated, the
//defector would serve a single year, and the cooperator would serve four.

// 6655
//And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing the other one’s
//choice, and neither would be given a chance to change their decision afterward.

// 6656
//Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eaters during the
//Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors.

// 6657
//Harry had nodded and said that was __one__ way to resolve the Prisoner’s
//Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would __want__ there to be a Dark
//Lord for exactly that reason.

// 6658
//(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this for a while
//before they continued. It had explained a __lot __about why Father and his
//friends had agreed to serve under a Dark Lord who often wasn’t nice to them…)

// 6659
//In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why people had
//governments - __you__ might be better off if you stole from someone else,
//just like each prisoner would be individually better off if they defected in
//the Prisoner’s Dilemma. But if __everyone__ thought like that, the country
//would fall into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen
//if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by governments,
//just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled by the Dark Lord.

// 6660
//(Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for granted that
//ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they wanted to rule, and
//people let themselves be ruled because they were scared little Hufflepuffs. And
//this, on reflection, still seemed true; but Harry’s perspective was fascinating
//even if it was wrong.)

// 6661
//But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party punishing you was
//not the __only__ possible reason to cooperate in the Prisoner’s Dilemma.

// 6662
//Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magically produced
//identical copy of yourself.

// 6663
//Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither Draco would
//want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to mention that no Malfoy
//would let himself become known as a traitor.

// 6664
//Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet __another__ solution to
//the Prisoner’s Dilemma - people might cooperate because they cared about each
//other, or because they had senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve
//their reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to construct
//a __true__ Prisoner’s Dilemma - in real life, people usually cared about
//the other person, or their honor or their reputation or a Dark Lord’s
//punishment or __something__ besides the prison sentences. But suppose the
//copy had been of someone __completely__ selfish -

// 6665
//(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they’d used)

// 6666
//- so each Pansy only cared what happened to __her__ and not to the other
  //Pansy.

// 6667
//__Given__ that this was all Pansy cared about… and that there was no Dark
//Lord… and Pansy wasn’t worried about her reputation… and Pansy either had no
//sense of honor or didn’t consider herself obligated to the other prisoner…
//__then__ would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?

// 6668
//Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do was for Pansy to
//defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone named Douglas Hofstadter,
//thought these people were wrong. Because, Harry had said, if Pansy defected -
//not at random, but for what seemed to her like __rational reasons__ - then
//the other Pansy would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn’t
//decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in which both
//Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies defected, and she was
//better off if both copies cooperated. And if Harry had thought ‘rational’
//people __did__ defect in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, then he wouldn’t have
//done anything to spread that kind of ‘rationality’, because a country or a
//conspiracy full of ‘rational’ people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell
//your __enemies__ about ‘rationality’.

// 6669
//Which had all __sounded__ reasonable at the time, but __now__ the
//thought was occurring to Draco that…

// 6670
//“__You__ said,” Draco said, “that the rational solution to the Prisoner’s
//Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course __you__ would want me to believe
//that, wouldn’t you?” And if Draco was fooled into cooperating, Harry would just
//say, __Ha ha, betrayed you again!__ and laugh at him about it afterward.

// 6671
//“I wouldn’t fake your lessons,” Harry said seriously. “But I have to remind
//you, Draco, that I didn’t say you should just automatically cooperate. Not on a
//__true__ Prisoner’s Dilemma like this one. What I said was that when you
//choose, you shouldn’t think like you’re choosing for just yourself, __or__
//like you’re choosing for everyone. You should think like you’re choosing for
//all the people who are __similar enough__ to you that they’ll probably do
//the same thing you do for the same reasons. And also choosing the predictions
//made by anyone who knows you well enough to predict you accurately, so that you
//never have to regret being rational because of the correct predictions that
//other people make about you - remind me to explain about Newcomb’s Problem at
//some point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this: are we
//similar enough that we’ll probably do the __same thing__ whatever it is,
//making our decisions in mostly the same way? Or do we know each other well
//enough to predict each other, so that __I __can predict whether you’ll
//cooperate or defect, and __you__ can predict that I’ve decided to do the
//same thing I predict you’ll do, because __I__ know that you can predict me
//deciding that?”

// 6672
//…and Draco could not help but think that since he had to strain just to
//understand __half __of that, the answer was obviously ‘No’.

// 6673
//“Yes,” said Draco.

// 6674
//There was a pause.

// 6675
//“I see,” said Harry, sounding disappointed. “Oh, well. I guess we’ll have to
//think of some other way, then.”

// 6676
//Draco hadn’t thought that was going to work.

// 6677
//Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both agreed much
//earlier that what they did on the battlefield would __not__ count as
//broken promises in real life - though Draco was a little angry about what Harry
//had done in Professor Quirrell’s office, and said so.

// 6678
//But if the two of them couldn’t rely on honor or friendship, that __did__
//leave the question of how to get their armies to work together on beating
//Sunshine, despite everything Granger might try to break them up. Professor
//Quirrell’s rules didn’t make it tempting to let Sunshine kill the other army’s
//soldiers - that just increased the bar you had to pass yourself - but it did
//tempt each side to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or
//to shoot some of the other side’s soldiers during the confusion of battle…

// 6679
//Hermione was walking back to Ravenclaw not really looking where she was going,
//her mind preoccupied with war and treachery and other age-inappropriate
//concepts, and she turned a corner and bumped straight into a grownup.

// 6680
//“Sorry,” she said automatically, and then, entirely without thinking,
//“__Eeeeek!__”

// 6681
//“Don’t worry, Miss Granger,” said the cheerful smile, set beneath the twinkling
//eyes, and above the silver beard, of the HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS. “You are quite
//forgiven.”

// 6682
//Her gaze was helplessly locked on the kindly face of the most powerful wizard
//in the world, who was also the Chief Warlock, who was also the Supreme Mugwump,
//who had gone insane years ago from the stress of fighting the Dark Lord, and
//numerous other facts that were popping up into her mind one after the other
//while her throat went on making little embarrassing squeaks.

// 6683
//“In fact, Miss Granger,” said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, “it is
//quite lucky that we bumped into each other. Why, I was just now wondering
//curiously what the three of you were thinking of asking for your wishes…”

// 6684
//Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking in hushed
//voices, as though the first to shout might set off the explosion.

// 6685
//Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels of Hogwarts
//again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights were more likely to take
//place in cities than forests, and fighting inside schoolrooms and corridors was
//supposed to simulate that, with ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army
//had done well in those fights.

// 6686
//Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come up with
//something __special__ for this battle.

// 6687
//The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.

// 6688
//And not in boats, either.

// 6689
//They were fighting __underwater__.

// 6690
//The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been set in place to
//keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had gone and talked to the
//merfolk; and all the soldiers had been issued __potions of underwater
//action __that allowed them to breathe, see clearly, talk to each other, and swim
//not quite as fast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.

// 6691
//A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground, shining like a
//small underwater moon. It would help to provide a sense of direction - at
//first. The moon would slowly go into eclipse as the battle went on, and when it
//had gone entirely dark, the battle would end if it hadn’t already.

// 6692
//War in water. You couldn’t defend a perimeter, attackers could come at you from
//any direction, and even with the potion you couldn’t see very far in the
//darkness of the lake.

// 6693
//And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to glow after a
//while, and be easy to hunt down - ordinarily if an army scattered and ran
//instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell would just declare them defeated; but
//today they were working on a points system. Of course you still had some time
//__before__ you started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.

// 6694
//Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the game; above and
//far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The murky water was mostly lit by
//__Lumos__ Charms, though his soldiers would extinguish the lights as soon
//as they began maneuvers. There was no point in letting the enemy see you before
//you saw them.

// 6695
//Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher position from
//which he could gaze down at where his soldiers hovered in the water.

// 6696
//The conversations died down almost at once under Draco’s icy glare, his
//soldiers looking up at him with gratifying expressions of fear and worry.

// 6697
//“Listen to me very carefully,” said General Malfoy. His voice came out a little
//lower, a little burbly with bubbles, __libsten to me vebwy caerbfully__,
//but the sound traveled clearly. “There’s only one way we can win this. We’ve
//got to march on Sunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. __Then__
//we fight it out with Potter and win. That’s __got__ to happen, understand?
//No matter what else goes on, that part __has__ to happen that way -”

// 6698
//And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.

// 6699
//Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.

// 6700
//“- and if any of __your__ plots get in the way of that,” finished Draco,
//“after we are out of the water, I will set you on __fire__.”

// 6701
//There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.

// 6702
//“And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out __to the
//letter,__” said Draco.

// 6703
//Around half his soldiers __openly nodded,__ and Draco marked them for
//death after he rose to power.

// 6704
//Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon being told to offer
//a false traitor’s commission to another Dragon, and the second Dragon being
//told in hushed confidence to report anything said by the first Dragon. Draco
//had told each Dragon that the whole war could depend on that one thing, and
//that he hoped they understood it was more important than the plans they’d
//previously made. With luck that would keep all the idiots happy, and maybe
//flush out a few spies to boot, if the reports didn’t match the instructions.

// 6705
//Draco’s real plan for winning against Chaos… well, it was simpler than the one
//he’d burned, but Father still wouldn’t have liked it. Despite trying, though,
//Draco hadn’t been able to think of anything better. It was a plot that couldn’t
//__possibly__ have worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In fact it
//had __been__ Harry’s plan originally, according to the traitor, though
//Draco had guessed that without being told. Draco and the traitor had just
//modified it a little…

// 6706
//Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in his lungs.

// 6707
//They’d fought in the forest, and he hadn’t gotten a chance to say it.

// 6708
//They’d fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn’t gotten a chance to
//say it.

// 6709
//They’d fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier, and it still
//hadn’t made sense to say it.

// 6710
//Harry had thought he wouldn’t ever get to say those words, not while he was
//still young enough for them to be real…

// 6711
//The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as their general
//swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant light of the surface, and his
//head pointed down toward the murky depths.

// 6712
//“__Why are you upside down?__” the young commander shouted at his army,
//and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned the privileged
//orientation of gravity.

// 6713
//A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the instant, Zabini and
//Anthony and five other soldiers struck out downward, into the murky depths of
//the lake. Parvati Patil, the only Gryffindor in the group, turned her head back
//for a moment and gave them all a cheery wave as she dived; and after a moment,
//Scott and Matt did the same. The rest just sank and vanished.

// 6714
//General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched them go. She was
//risking everything on this, dividing her army instead of just trying to take as
//many enemy soldiers with them as possible.

// 6715
//The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army would move until
//they had a plan that let them expect victory. Sunshine couldn’t just plan to
//win themselves, they had to make both other armies __think__ they would
//win until it was too late.

// 6716
//Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was gazing after the
//disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her army, what was left of it,
//just looked bewildered, traceries of light dappling on their uniforms as they
//all drifted just below the sunlit surface of the lake.

// 6717
//“__Now__ what?” said Ron.

// 6718
//“Now we wait,” said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers to hear. It
//felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept feeling like she was
//committing some sort of horrible impoliteness at the dinner table and was about
//to drool all over herself. “All of us left here are going to get zapped, but
//that was going to happen anyway with Dragon and Chaos ganging up on us. We’ve
//just got to take as many of them with us as we can.”

// 6719
//“I’ve got a plan,” said one of her Sunshine Soldiers… Hannah, her voice had
//been a little hard to recognize at first. “It’s like all complicated, but I
//know how we can get Dragon and Chaos to start fighting each other -”

// 6720
//“Me too!” said Fay. “I’ve got a plan too! See, Neville Longbottom is secretly
//on our side -”

// 6721
//“__You__ were talking to Neville?” said Ernie. “That’s not right,
//__I__ was the one who -”

// 6722
//Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn’t gone with Zabini
//were giggling helplessly as the cries of “No, wait, __I__ was the one who
//got Longbottom” erupted from one soldier after another.

// 6723
//Hermione just looked at them all wearily.

// 6724
//“Okay,” said Hermione when it had all died down, “does everyone get it? All
//your plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe some by Dragon. Anyone who
//__really__ wanted to betray Harry or Malfoy went straight to me or Zabini,
//not you. Just go ahead and compare notes on all your secret plots and you’ll
//see it for yourselves.” She might not be as good at plotting as Zabini, but she
//could always understand what all her officers told her, that was why Professor
//Quirrell had made her the general. “So don’t bother trying to do any plots when
//the other armies get here. Just fight, okay? Please?”

// 6725
//“But,” said Ernie with shock on his face, “Neville is in __Hufflepuff!__
//You’re saying he __lied__ to us?”

// 6726
//Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the exhalations had turned
//her upside down in the water.

// 6727
//“I’m not sure __what__ Longbottom is,” said Ron darkly, “but I don’t think
//he’s a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that __Harry Potter’s__ got to him.”

// 6728
//“Do you know,” said Susan, “I __asked__ him that, and Neville told me he
//had become a Chaos Hufflepuff?”

// 6729
//“__Anyway__,” said Hermione in a loud voice. “Zabini took with everyone
//who we thought was a spy, so in __our__ army we can stop watching each
//other quite so hard now, I hope.”

// 6730
//“__Anthony__ was a spy?” yelled Ron.

// 6731
//“__Parvati __was a spy?” gasped Hannah.

// 6732
//“Parvati was __totally__ a spy,” said Daphne. “She shopped at the spy shoe
//store and wore spy lipstick, and someday she’s going to marry a nice spy
//husband and have a lot of little spies.”

// 6733
//And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating that Sunshine had
//just scored two points.

// 6734
//This was shortly followed by the triple gong of Dragon losing a single point.

// 6735
//Traitors weren’t allowed to kill generals, not after the disaster of the first
//battle in December when all three generals had been shot in the first minute.
//But with any luck…

// 6736
//“Aw,” said Hermione. “It sounds like Mr. Crabbe is taking a little nap.”

// 6737
//Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along.

// 6738
//Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions. Diving, always
//diving in whatever direction you happened to be moving. You wanted to show the
//enemy the smallest profile, present them with your head or your feet. So you
//were always diving, downward and head-first, and the enemy was always
//__down.__

// 6739
//Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville’s head was constantly
//rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every side. Not just watching
//for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any sign that a Chaos Legionnaire had
//drawn their wand and was about to betray them. Usually traitors waited until
//the confusion of battle to make their move, but that early gong had put them
//all on guard.

// 6740
//…the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In November he’d been a
//soldier in a united army, all of them pulling together and helping each other,
//and now they were all watching each other constantly for the first signs of
//betrayal. It might have been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn’t nearly
//as much fun for Neville.

// 6741
//The direction formerly known as ‘up’ was getting steadily brighter, as they
//came closer to the surface and Sunshine.

// 6742
//“Wands out,” said General Chaos.

// 6743
//Neville’s squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead toward the
//enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If there were Sunny
//traitors, the time was approaching for them to strike.

// 6744
//The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same thing.

// 6745
//“__Now!__” shouted the distant voice of the Dragon General.

// 6746
//“__Now!__” shouted General Chaos.

// 6747
//“__For Sunshine!”__ shouted all the soldiers in both armies, and charged
//downward.

// 6748
//“__What?__” said Minerva involuntarily as she watched the screens from
//next to the lake, a cry echoed in many other places; all of Hogwarts was
//watching this battle as they had watched the first.

// 6749
//Professor Quirrell was laughing dryly. “I warned you, Headmaster. It is
//impossible to have rules without Mr. Potter exploiting them.”

// 6750
//For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged her own
//seventeen, Hermione’s mind went blank.

// 6751
//Why…

// 6752
//Then it all snapped into place.

// 6753
//Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by someone crying the
//name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell point. When two Sunshine Soldiers
//were shot by either army, __both__ enemy armies would be two points closer
//to overtaking her, it was the same gain only __shared__. And if anyone
//shot another soldier __not__ in the name of Sunshine, that gong
//__wouldn’t__ get lost in the confusion…

// 6754
//Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn’t gone with the obvious plan
//of starting trouble between the other two armies while they attacked Sunshine.

// 6755
//It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances closing down, of
//hope being taken away.

// 6756
//Most of Hermione’s soldiers were still looking confused, but some had
//expressions of dawning horror as they got it.

// 6757
//“It’s all right,” Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look at the Sunshine
//Captain. “Our job is the same, to take as many of them with us as we can. And
//remember, Zabini took away all the spies! We don’t have to stay on the lookout
//like __they__ do!” The girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering
//smiles from many of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. “It can be
//like it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight our best,
//and trust each other -”

// 6758
//Daphne shot her.

// 6759
//“__Blood for the blood god!__” shrieked Neville of Chaos, though since he
//was underwater it came out more like ‘Blubbled for the blubbled glub!’

// 6760
//Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and fired. But Neville
//was swimming __downward__ toward him, wand pointed straight ahead, and
//that meant the Simple Shield could shelter Neville’s entire profile; if anyone
//shot him now, it wasn’t going to be Sunny Ron.

// 6761
//A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley’s face, and he arrowed
//straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word __Contego,__ though the
//shield wasn’t visible in the water.

// 6762
//The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows released from bows,
//each aimed to split the other down the middle. They had dueled many times
//before, but this time would pay for all.

// 6763
//(Far away by the lakeside, a hundred breaths were held.)

// 6764
//“__Rainbows and unicorns!__” roared the Sunshine Captain.

// 6765
//“__The Black Goat with a thousand young!__”

// 6766
//“__Do your homework!__”

// 6767
//Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither willing to swerve,
//the first person to turn would present a vulnerable broadside and get shot,
//though if neither lost their nerve they would crash right into each other…

// 6768
//Falling straight down as the enemy rose straight up to meet him, hammer
//descending to meet anvil in a path neither was willing to leave…

// 6769
//“__Special attack, Chaotic Twist!__”

// 6770
//Neville saw the look of horror on Captain Weasley’s face as the Hover Charm
//caught him. They’d tested it before the battle had started; and just as Harry
//had suspected, __Wingardium Leviosa__ became a whole new sort of weapon
//once everyone was swimming underwater.

// 6771
//“__Curse you, Longbottom!__” shrieked Ron Weasley, ”__Can’t you ever
//fight without your dumb special attacks -__”

// 6772
//and by that time the Sunshine Captain had been spun around sideways and Neville
//shot him in the leg.

// 6773
//“I don’t fight fair,” said Neville to the sleeping form, “I fight like Harry
//Potter.”

// 6774
//__Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220__

// 6775
//It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could hardly stand to
//look at the expression of peace that had come over her sleeping face, arms now
//drifting aimlessly as the curves of sunlight moved over her camouflage uniform
//and the cloud of her chestnut hair.

// 6776
//And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot her… not only
//would Draco have known what it meant, __Hermione__ would have been
//offended.

// 6777
//__She’s not dead,__ Harry said to his brain as his kicking feet pushed him
//away, __she’s just resting. IDIOT.__

// 6778
//__Are you sure?__ said his brain. __What if she’s an ex-Hermione?
//Could we go back and check?__

// 6779
//Harry glanced back briefly.

// 6780
//__See, she’s fine, there are bubbles coming out of her mouth.__

// 6781
//__Could’ve been her last breath escaping.__

// 6782
//__Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective, anyway?__

// 6783
//__Er, first real friend we’ve ever had in our whole life? Hey, remember
//what happened to our pet rock?__

// 6784
//__Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it wasn’t even
//alive let alone sentient, that is like the most pathetic childhood trauma ever
//-__

// 6785
//The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish once more.

// 6786
//General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three Chaotics and
//two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons had been shot as
//traitors. So she’d lost net seven points, Harry had lost one, Draco had lost
//two; that put Sunshine twenty points up on Dragon, and seventeen points up on
//Chaos. Chaos could still win easily if they exterminated all twenty remaining
//Dragons. The wild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine
//Soldiers…

// 6787
//…if you could call them that.

// 6788
//The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in each army
//awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and attack…

// 6789
//“Everyone who got them,” Harry said loudly, “remember Special Orders One
//through Three. And don’t forget it’s Merlin Says on Three. Do not acknowledge.”

// 6790
//The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the other third just
//looked puzzled.

// 6791
//__Special Order One: Don’t bother trying to call out any codewords in
//this battle, don’t expend effort on any plot not specially approved by the
//commander; just swim, shield, and fire.__

// 6792
//Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying to get them to
//stop plotting on their own all through December. Harry had egged his soldiers
//on and supported their plotting through the last two battles… while also
//telling them that at some __future__ point he might ask them to put a plot
//or two on hold, to which they’d all readily agreed. So now, in this critical
//battle, they were happy to obey.

// 6793
//Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order successfully, Harry was
//certain. It was the difference between your soldiers seeing you as an ally in
//their plotting, and seeing you as a spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn’t want
//them to have any fun. Imposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it
//also worked in reverse…

// 6794
//“There they are!” shouted someone, and pointed.

// 6795
//From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones who’d forsaken
//the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine Soldiers, glowing with the bright
//aura of cowards, now fading as they returned to battle.

// 6796
//The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.

// 6797
//“Hold your fire!” shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from General Malfoy.

// 6798
//There was a moment of held breath.

// 6799
//Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon Army.

// 6800
//There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.

// 6801
//There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.

// 6802
//Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn’t have.

// 6803
//Harry wasn’t smiling.

// 6804
//__Oh, this is so completely not going to work…__

// 6805
//But Harry hadn’t been able to think of anything better.

// 6806
//“Special Orders Two and Three still apply!” shouted Harry. “Fight!”

// 6807
//“__For the Chaos Legion!__” roared twenty Chaotic Legionnaires.

// 6808
//“__For Dragon Army!__” roared twenty Dragon Warriors and seven Sunshine
//Soldiers.

// 6809
//And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors got ready to
//strike.

// 6810
//__Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226__

// 6811
//Draco’s head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up what was happening;
//somehow, despite his greater forces, he’d __lost the initiative.__ Four
//small Chaotic forces were being pursued by four larger Dragon forces, but
//because Draco’s forces were the ones trying to force an engagement, it meant
//that they had to __follow__ where Chaos __ran,__ and somehow that was
//producing concentrations of Chaotic force that would fire into the exposed
//sides of Dragon -

// 6812
//It was happening __again!__

// 6813
//“__Prismatis!__” shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that shield you
//could see even through the water, a sparkling multicolored flat wall wide
//enough to shield Draco and the five other Dragons with him from the Chaotic
//force that had just started firing on them as they swam past, and __that__
//let the other five Dragons turn __their__ attentions back to the Chaotic
//force they’d been chasing -

// 6814
//There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell crashed into Draco’s
//Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin that none of those four Chaotics
//had learned the Breaking Drill Hex -

// 6815
//Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic force spun
//head-for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his hands now shaking
//slightly, dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered his wand.

// 6816
//Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on broomsticks.

// 6817
//“__Do not pursue!__” Draco cried to his soldiers as they started to
//follow, then, ”__Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!__”

// 6818
//The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaotic forces spun
//around and began __pursuing__ the Dragons on the instant - Draco swore out
//loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic victory, someone hadn’t gotten their
//Simple Shield oriented right - and then the Dragon forces were in supporting
//range of each other and the Chaotics were moving back into the murky distance.

// 6819
//Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons had scored three
//times against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scored four times back, and
//he’d heard one Dragon spy get executed. Either Harry Potter had thought of a
//lot of very good ideas very fast, or for some unimaginable reason he’d already
//spent a lot of time working out how to fight underwater. This wasn’t working,
//and Draco needed to rethink things.

// 6820
//It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while swimming, too, the
//battle might last long enough that time would be called… the distant underwater
//moon was only half full now, that wasn’t good… he had to rethink things
//__fast…__

// 6821
//“What is it?” said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over toward Draco.

// 6822
//Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful, and better yet,
//she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which made her
//__trustworthy.__ Working with Padma was making him realize the truth of
//the old adage that Ravenclaw was sister to Slytherin; Draco had been surprised
//when his father had told him it was an acceptable House for his future wife,
//but now he saw the sense of it.

// 6823
//“Wait until we’re all here,” Draco said. The truth was, he needed to catch his
//breath. That was the trouble with being the general __and__ the most
//powerful wizard, you had to keep using magic.

// 6824
//Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and four Dragons, one of
//whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Draco didn’t trust Zabini. And
//neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the Sunnies enough to make them a majority of
//any unit; they were __supposed__ to be loyal either to Draco directly, or
//to Granger who’d been fooled by the promise that the Dragons would be betrayed
//in the end after both forces had been depleted, just as Harry’s more trusted
//Chaotics should’ve been fooled into not shooting at the Sunnies by the promise
//of their firing fake Sleep Hexes and switching to support Chaos later; but it
//was possible some of the Sunnies __were__ loyal to Chaos and
//__weren’t__ firing real Sleep Hexes and that was why Dragon wasn’t winning
//the way their numerical advantage should’ve let them win…

// 6825
//The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers holding wands on two
//other soldiers, who were swimming with empty hands.

// 6826
//Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to talk to Professor
//Quirrell about having some way to __punish__ traitors at least, conditions
//like these were __unrealistic__, in real life you tortured your traitors
//to death.

// 6827
//“General Malfoy!” shouted the commander of the problem unit as it swam up, a
//Ravenclaw boy named Terry. “We don’t know what to do - Cesi shot Bogdan, but
//Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shot Specter -”

// 6828
//“I __didn’t!__” said Kellah.

// 6829
//“Yes you __did!__” shrieked Cesi. “General Malfoy, __she’s__ the spy,
//I should’ve rea-”

// 6830
//“__Somnium,__” said Draco.

// 6831
//There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and then Kellah’s
//limp body began to float away in the water.

// 6832
//Draco __had__ heard the word ‘recursion’ by this point, and he knew a
//Harry Potter plot when he saw one.

// 6833
//(Unfortunately Draco had __not__ heard of autoimmune disorders, and the
//thought did __not__ readily occur to him that a clever virus would begin
//its attack by creating symptoms of an autoimmune disorder so as to get the body
//to distrust its own immune system…)

// 6834
//“__General order!__” said Draco, raising his voice. “Nobody gets to shoot
//spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and Terry. If anyone sees anything
//suspicious they come to one of __us.__”

// 6835
//And then -

// 6836
//There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.

// 6837
//“__What?__” said Draco and Zabini around the same time; their heads
//swiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and all the Sunshine
//soldiers were present and accounted for. (Except Parvati, who had been shot by
//some still-unknown traitor in Padma’s squad; and of course Padma had shot
//Parvati again in case she was faking, so it wasn’t her…)

// 6838
//“A Sunny traitor in Chaos?” said Zabini, sounding puzzled. “But all the ones I
//knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos’s attack on Sunshine -”

// 6839
//“No!” said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. “That was __Chaos__
//executing a spy!”

// 6840
//“__What?__” said Zabini. “But why -”

// 6841
//And Draco got it. __Damn it!__ “Because Potter thinks he’s safe for how
//much he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats __us!__ So he
//doesn’t want to lose a single point when he executes a traitor! __General
//order!__ If you have to execute a traitor, call Sunshine first! And don’t forget
//to switch back to Dragon afterward -”

// 6842
//__Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252__

// 6843
//Longbottom’s body drifted chaotically through the water, arms and legs
//disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they’d all shot him
//__again__ just to be sure.

// 6844
//Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere, looking at them
//all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon slowly diminished, somewhere far
//away. If Longbottom had managed to shoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was
//thinking), if the two Chaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer,
//they might have __won__…

// 6845
//After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the ensuing battle
//and execution of spies in Sunshine’s name had left Sunshine exactly one point
//ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once Harry had started doing it, Draco had been
//left with no choice but to follow suit.

// 6846
//But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the survivors of
//Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor: Draco, and Padma, and Zabini.

// 6847
//And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini’s wand after
//Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco. The boy had given him
//an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him for this, and handed it over.

// 6848
//That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.

// 6849
//“I don’t suppose you’d like to surrender?” said Draco, smiling as evilly as any
//smile he’d ever directed at Harry Potter.

// 6850
//“Sleep before surrender!” shouted General Chaos.

// 6851
//“Just so you know,” said Draco, “Zabini doesn’t actually __have__ an older
//sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor bullies. But Zabini __does__ have
//a mother who doesn’t approve of Muggleborns like Granger, and I wrote her a few
//notes, and offered Zabini a few favors - nothing involving my father, just
//things __I__ can do in school. And by the way, Zabini’s mother doesn’t
//approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you still thought Zabini was
//really on your side.”

// 6852
//Harry’s face grew even grimmer.

// 6853
//Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically, building up strength
//for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger’s Prismatic Sphere was almost as strong as
//Draco’s now, and Harry’s wasn’t much weaker, where did those two find
//__time?__

// 6854
//“__Lagann!__” spoke Draco, putting everything he had into it, and the
//green spiral blazed out and Harry’s shield shattered, and at almost the same
//moment -

// 6855
//“__Somnium!__” said Padma.

// 6856
//__Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254__

// 6857
//Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he didn’t have to
//hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was shaking as he lowered his
//wand.

// 6858
//“You know,” said Harry, “I was pretty worried there for a moment.”

// 6859
//__Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn’t seem to be really
//shooting at you, fake being hit occasionally. Prefer targeting Dragons to
//Sunnies but go ahead and shoot Sunnies if you can’t shoot Dragons.__

// 6860
//__Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise Zabini or
//either Patil twin.__

// 6861
//With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch off her
//uniform’s insignia, and let it float away in the water.

// 6862
//“Gryffindors for Chaos,” she said, and handed Zabini his wand back.

// 6863
//“Thank you __very__ much,” Harry said, and bowed sweepingly to the
//Gryffindor girl. “And thank __you__ as well,” bowing to Zabini. “You know,
//when you came to me with that plan, I wondered if you were brilliant or crazy,
//and I’ve decided that you’re both. And by the way,” Harry said, now turning as
//though to address Draco’s body, “Zabini __does__ have a cousin -”

// 6864
//“__Somnium,__” said Zabini’s voice.

// 6865
//__Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254__

// 6866
//And Harry Potter’s body floated away, his expression of shock and horror
//quickly relaxing into sleep.

// 6867
//“On second thought,” Parvati said cheerfully, “make that Gryffindors for
//Sunshine.”

// 6868
//She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she’d ever been in her life, she’d
//__finally__ gotten to assassinate and replace her twin sister and she’d
//wanted to do that since __forever,__ and this had been __perfect,__
//it had all been __perfect__ -

// 6869
//- and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as Zabini’s wand
  //turned to point at her.

// 6870
//“Wait!” said Zabini. “Do not shoot, do not resist. That’s an order.”

// 6871
//“__What?__” said Parvati.

// 6872
//“Sorry,” said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic, “but I can’t be
//totally __sure__ you’re for Sunshine. So I order you to let me shoot you.”

// 6873
//“__Hold on!__” said Parvati. “We’re only ahead of Chaos by one point! If
//you shoot me now -”

// 6874
//“I’ll shoot you in the name of Dragon, __obviously__,” said Zabini, now
//sounding a little superior. “Just because we tricked __them__ into doing
//it, doesn’t mean it won’t work for us.”

// 6875
//Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. “General Malfoy said your mother
//doesn’t like Hermione.”

// 6876
//“I suppose,” said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. “But some of us are
//more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a parent.”

// 6877
//“And Harry Potter said you have a cousin -”

// 6878
//“Nope,” said Zabini.

// 6879
//Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn’t really good at plotting;
//Zabini’d said the plan was to secretly keep the scores of Chaos and Dragon as
//even as possible so they’d use Sunshine’s name to execute their traitors
//instead of losing even a single point, and that had __worked__… but… she
//had the feeling she was missing something, she wasn’t a Slytherin…

// 6880
//“Why don’t __I__ shoot __you__ in the name of Dragon?” said Parvati.

// 6881
//“Because I outrank you,” said Zabini.

// 6882
//Parvati had a bad feeling about this.

// 6883
//She stared at him for a long moment.

// 6884
//And then -

// 6885
//“__Somni-__” she started to say, and then realized she hadn’t said
//__for Dragon,__ and frantically cut herself off -

// 6886
//__Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254__

// 6887
//“Hey, everyone,” said Blaise Zabini’s face on the screens, looking quite
//amused, “guess it’s all down to me.”

// 6888
//All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.

// 6889
//Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.

// 6890
//Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon or Chaos, or
//just leave things the way they were.

// 6891
//A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was running out.

// 6892
//And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and casually toying
//with his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the dark water.

// 6893
//“You know,” said Blaise Zabini’s voice, in the tones of someone who’d been
//rehearsing the words for a while, “it’s just a game, really. And games are
//supposed to be __fun.__ So how about if I just do whatever I feel like?”
