//__Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.__

// 11799
//So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could quibble about the
//details of the proverb, Harry understood the weaknesses of Ravenclaws well
//enough to know that you had to try __answering__ your own quibbles. Did
//some plans call for waiting? Yes, many plans called for __delayed
//action__; but that was not the same as __hesitating__ to __choose__.
//Not delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was necessary, but
//delaying because you couldn’t make up your mind - there was no cunning plan
//which called for that.

// 11800
//Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that could also
//turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be __tempting__ to delay,
//when you were faced with a choice between two painful alternatives, and
//__not choosing__ would avoid the mental pain for a time. So you would pick
//a piece of information you couldn’t easily obtain, and claim that you couldn’t
//possibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Although if you knew
//__what__ information you needed, knew __when__ and __how__ you
//would obtain that information, and knew what you would __do__ depending on
//each possible observation, then that was less suspicious as an excuse for
//hesitating.

// 11801
//If you __weren’t__ just hesitating, you ought to be able to choose
//__in advance__ what you would do, once you had the extra information you
//claimed you needed.

// 11802
//If the Dark Lord were __really__ out there, would it be smart to go along
//with Professor Quirrell’s plan to have someone impersonate the Dark Lord?

// 11803
//No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.

// 11804
//And if Harry knew for a __fact__ that the Dark Lord __wasn’t__ really
//out there… in __that__ case…

// 11805
//The Defense Professor’s office was a small room, at least today; it had changed
//since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of the room becoming darker,
//more polished. Behind the Defense Professor’s desk stood the single empty
//bookcase that always decorated the room, a tall bookcase stretching almost from
//the floor to the ceiling, with seven empty wooden shelves. Harry had only once
//seen Professor Quirrell take a book from those empty shelves, and never seen
//him put a book back.

// 11806
//The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the Defense
//Professor’s desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at Harry from close to
//his own eye level.

// 11807
//They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be cast within
//Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster’s attention.

// 11808
//“__No,__” hissed Harry.

// 11809
//The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion was conveyed
//by the gesture, not that Harry’s Parselmouth talent conveyed to him.
//“__Reasson not?__” said the green snake.

// 11810
//“__Too rissky,__” Harry said simply. That was true whether or not the Dark
//Lord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in advance had made him realize
//that he’d just been using the unanswered question as an excuse to hesitate; the
//sane decision was the same, either way.

// 11811
//For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a moment the
//scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. “__Think you have learned wrong
//lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit of failing,
//and lasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss.
//Correct lessson iss to follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser
//Sslytherin, tame your wild impulssess.”__

// 11812
//“__Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child
//friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid,__” Harry snapped
//back. He’d been planning a more temporizing response than that, but somehow the
//words had just slipped out.

// 11813
//The __sssss__-ing sound that came from the snake was not heard by Harry as
//words, only as pure fury. A moment later, “__You told them -__”

// 11814
//“__Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.__”

// 11815
//There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at Harry; again no
//detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered what Professor Quirrell
//could be thinking that would take Professor Quirrell that long to think.

// 11816
//“__You sserioussly care what thosse two think?__” came the snake’s final
//hiss. ”__True younglingss thosse two are, not like you. Could not weigh
//adult matterss.__”

// 11817
//“__Might have done better than me,__” Harry hissed. ”__Boy-child
//friend would have assked after ssecret motivess before asssenting to resscue
//woman -__”

// 11818
//“__Glad you undersstand that now,__” the snake hissed coldly.
//”__Alwayss assk after other’ss advantage. Next learn to alwayss assk
//after your own. If my plan iss not to your tasste, what iss yours?__”

// 11819
//“__If necesssary - sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy. Hogwartss
//sseemss fine place to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange but tassty food.__”
//Harry wanted to chuckle, but there wasn’t any gesture in Parseltongue for the
//kind of laughter he wanted to express.

// 11820
//The pits of the snake’s eyes seemed almost black. “__Eassy to ssay that
//now. Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate imprissonment. You will losse
//patience long before sseventh year, perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall
//plan accordingly.__”

// 11821
//And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, the human-shape of
//Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once more. “So, Mr. Potter,” said
//the Defense Professor, his voice as calm as if they had been discussing nothing
//important, as if the whole conversation had not occurred at all, “I hear that
//you have begun to practice dueling. Not the worthless sort with __rules__,
//I hope?”

// 11822
//Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her (except on the
//day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had escaped, which shouldn’t ought
//to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff girl had come over to the Ravenclaw table
//during dinner, and tapped Hermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her
//away -

// 11823
//“Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr. Diggory!” Hannah
//blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from the table.

// 11824
//“Who?” said Hermione.

// 11825
//“__Cedric Diggory!__” said Hannah. “He’s the Captain of our Quidditch
//Team, and general of an army, and he’s taking __all__ the electives and
//getting better grades than anyone, and I hear he learns dueling from
//professional tutors during the summers, and he once beat __two__
//seventh-year students, and even some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff,
//and Professor Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something like
//that, and -”

// 11826
//After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a while),
//Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.

// 11827
//“Sunshine Soldier Abbott!” said Hermione. “Calm __down__. We’re not going
//to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville’s studying to beat us, but
//we can study too -”

// 11828
//“Don’t you __see?__” Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a lot louder than
//it should’ve been, if they were trying to keep the conversation private from
//all the Ravenclaws looking at them. “Neville isn’t studying to beat
//__us!__ He’s practicing so he can fight __Bellatrix Black!__ They’re
//going to go through us like a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!”

// 11829
//The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. “Listen,” said Hermione, “I don’t
//think a few weeks of practice is going to make anyone an invincible fighter.
//Plus we already __know__ how to handle invincible fighters. We’ll
//concentrate fire on them and they’ll go down just like Draco.”

// 11830
//The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and skepticism.
//“Aren’t you even, you know, __worried?__”

// 11831
//“Oh, __honestly!__” said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard being the only
//sensible person in your whole school year. “Haven’t you ever heard the saying,
//the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?”

// 11832
//“__What?__” said Hannah. “That’s crazy, what about Lethifolds lurking in
//the darkness, and being put under the Imperius Curse, and horrible
//Transfiguration accidents and -”

// 11833
//“I __mean,__” said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into her now-raised
//voice, she’d been hearing this sort of thing __all week__ now, “how about
//if we wait until __after__ the Chaos Legion __actually__ crushes us
//to get so scared of them and __did you just mutter ‘Gryffindors’ under
//your voice?__”

// 11834
//A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at the table with a
//sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it wasn’t the terrible cold glare of
//Harry’s dark side but it was the scariest face __she__ knew how to make.

// 11835
//Harry Potter was going __down.__

// 11836
//“This is loony,” gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath he could spare
//from being completely out of breath.

// 11837
//“This is __brilliant!__” said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of the Super
//Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like the sweat on his
//forehead as he stamped his feet through the dance of one of his dueling
//postures. His usually-light steps had changed to heavier stomps, which might
//have had something to do with the Transfigured metal weights they’d all
//attached to their arms and legs and strapped over their chests. “Where do you
//__get__ these ideas, Mr. Potter?”

// 11838
//“A strange old shop… in Oxford… and I’m never… shopping there… again.”
//__Thud.__
