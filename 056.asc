//== TSPE, Constrained Optimization, Pt 6

// 9843
//Silent, it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next level down. Either
//there wasn’t someone behind there, or they were hurting quietly, maybe they
//were screaming but their voice had given out already, or they were just
//muttering quietly to themselves in the dark…

// 9844
//__I’m not sure I can do this,__ Harry thought, and he couldn’t blame the
//despairing thought on the Dementors either. It would be better to be lower,
//safer to be lower, his plan would take time to implement and the Aurors were
//probably already working their way down. But if Harry had to pass any more of
//those metal doors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly
//regular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himself behind at each
//one, soon there wouldn’t be anything left of him -

// 9845
//A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front of Harry’s
//Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn’t have helped his image with
//Bellatrix.

// 9846
//“Harry!” said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as alarmed as Harry
//had ever heard from her. “Where are you? Are you all right? This is my
//Patronus, answer me!”

// 9847
//With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed his throat, forced
//calm, swapped in a different personality like an Occlumency barrier. It took a
//few seconds and he hoped like hell that Professor McGonagall didn’t notice a
//problem with that thanks to the communications delay, just as he hoped like
//hell that Patronuses didn’t report on their surroundings.

// 9848
//A young boy’s innocent voice said, “I’m in Mary’s Place, Professor, in Diagon
//Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What’s wrong?”

// 9849
//The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly, dusty appreciative
//laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a hiss from Harry.

// 9850
//A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor McGonagall’s voice, “I’m
//coming to pick you up right now. Don’t go __anywhere__, if you’re not
//around the Defense Professor don’t go back to him, don’t say anything to
//anyone, I’ll be there as quickly as I can!”

// 9851
//And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.

// 9852
//Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that after he got
//everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored the Time-Turner again, he
//could go back and be in the restroom of Mary’s Place at the appropriate time…

// 9853
//__You know,__ said the problem-solving part of his brain, __there’s
//a limit to how many constraints you can add to a problem before it __really is
//__impossible, you know that?__

// 9854
//It shouldn’t have mattered, and it didn’t really, it didn’t compare to the
//suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet Harry still found himself
//feeling very aware that if his plan didn’t end with him being picked up from
//Mary’s Place just like he’d never left, and the Defense Professor looking
//completely innocent of any and all wrongdoing, Professor McGonagall was going
//to __kill him.__

// 9855
//As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C spiral,
//shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous shield to their rear,
//Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and wondering if she ought to consult
//the obvious expert. If only he wasn’t so -

// 9856
//Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would see as she
//turned.

// 9857
//A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their wands on the old
//wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver beard who had appeared directly
//within their midst, a bright red-golden phoenix on his shoulder.

// 9858
//“Hold your fire!” Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but faking the
//phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult - the wards permitted it
//as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though there were no fast ways out.

// 9859
//The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long moment.

// 9860
//(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors had sent the
//word, there were several former members of the Order of the Phoenix with her;
//she tried to remember, in the back of her mind, if she’d seen Emmeline’s
//sparrow or Andy’s cat missing from the flock of bright creatures; but she knew
//that it was futile. It might not even be any of her people, for the old meddler
//often knew things he had no way at all of knowing.)

// 9861
//Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous gesture. “I hope I
//am not unwelcome here,” the wizard said calmly. “We are all on the same side,
//are we not?”

// 9862
//“That depends,” Amelia said in a hard voice. “Are you here to help us catch
//criminals, or to protect them from the consequences of their actions?”
//__Are you going to try to stop the killer of my brother from getting her
//well-deserved Kiss, old meddler?__ From what Amelia heard, Dumbledore had gotten
//smarter toward the end of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye’s nonstop nagging; but
//had relapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort’s body was found.

// 9863
//A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the shining animals,
//gleamed off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses as he spoke. “Even less than you
//would I see Bellatrix Black freed,” the old wizard said. “She __must__ not
//leave this prison alive, Amelia.”

// 9864
//Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised gratification,
//the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and a blazing silver phoenix
//sprang into existence, brighter perhaps than all their other Patronuses put
//together. It was the first time she’d seen that spell cast wordlessly. “Order
//all your Aurors to cancel their Patronus Charms for ten seconds,” said the old
//wizard. “What darkness cannot find, the light may.”

// 9865
//Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, who would notify
//all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding Dumbledore’s will to be done.

// 9866
//That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful silence, none of the
//Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to weigh her own thoughts.
//__She must not leave this prison alive…__ Albus Dumbledore wouldn’t turn
//into Bartemius Crouch without a strong reason. If he’d meant to tell her
//__why__, he already would have; but it certainly wasn’t a positive sign.

// 9867
//Still, it was good to know they’d be able to work together on this one.

// 9868
//“Now,” said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms winked out except
//that blazing silver phoenix.

// 9869
//“Is there another Patronus still present?” the old wizard said clearly to the
//bright creature.

// 9870
//The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.

// 9871
//“Can you find it?”

// 9872
//The silver head nodded again.

// 9873
//“Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?”

// 9874
//A final nod from the blazing phoenix.

// 9875
//“It is done,” Dumbledore said.

// 9876
//“Over,” said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised her wand and
//began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some extra concentration,
//with that wolfish smile already on her face, to think of the first time Susan
//had kissed her cheek, instead of dwelling on the looming fate of Bellatrix
//Black. That other Kiss was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind
//for the Patronus Charm.)

// 9877
//They hadn’t even gotten to the end of that corridor before Harry’s Patronus
//raised its hand, politely, as though in a classroom.

// 9878
//Harry thought quickly. The question was how to - no, that was also obvious.

// 9879
//“It seems,” Harry said in a coldly amused voice, “that someone has instructed
//this Patronus to speak its message only to me.” He chuckled. “Well then. Pardon
//me, dear Bella. __Quietus.__”

// 9880
//At once the silver humanoid said in Harry’s own voice, “There is another
//Patronus which seeks this Patronus.”

// 9881
//“__What?__” said Harry. And then, without pausing to think about what was
//happening, “Can you block it? Stop it from finding you?”

// 9882
//The silver humanoid shook its head.

// 9883
//No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their Patronus
//Charms, when -

// 9884
//The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden phoenix followed
//it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of them with his long wand
//gripped low.

// 9885
//The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard like water, and
//closed behind him with hardly a ripple.

// 9886
//“__Albus!__” shouted Amelia. “What do you think you’re doing?”

// 9887
//But she already knew.

// 9888
//“Do not follow me,” the old wizard’s voice said sternly. “I can protect myself,
//I cannot protect others.”

// 9889
//The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors flinch.

// 9890
//__This isn’t fair, isn’t fair, isn’t fair! There’s a limit to how many
//constraints you can add to a problem before it really is impossible!__

// 9891
//Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he was feeling, and
//forced his mind to confront the new requirements, he had to think
//__fast,__ use the adrenaline on following the chains of logic quickly and
//without hesitation, instead of wasting it on despair.

// 9892
//For the mission to succeed,

// 9893
//(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.

// 9894
//(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the Patronus was
//dispelled.

// 9895
//(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors’ drain after his Patronus was
//dispelled.

// 9896
//…

// 9897
//__If I solve this one,__ said Harry’s brain, __I want a cookie
//afterward, and if you make the problem any more difficult than this, I mean the
//slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing out of your skull and heading for
//Tahiti.__

// 9898
//Harry and his brain considered the problem.

// 9899
//Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the impossibility of
//evading the Dementors’ gaze. So if Harry found __another__ way to hide
//Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would rely on either his scientific knowledge
//or his realization that the Dementors were Death.

// 9900
//Harry’s brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the Dementors from seeing
//Bellatrix was to make her stop existing, i.e., kill her.

// 9901
//Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and told it to
//continue searching.

// 9902
//__Kill her and then bring her back,__ came the next suggestion.
//__Use Frigideiro to cool Bellatrix down to the point where her brain
//activity stops, then warm her up afterward using Thermos, just like people who
//fall into very cold water can be successfully revived half-an-hour later
//without noticeable brain damage.__

// 9903
//Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her debilitated state.
//__And__ it might not stop Death from seeing her. __And__ he’d have
//trouble carrying a cold unconscious Bellatrix very far. __And__ Harry
//couldn’t remember the research on which exact body temperature was supposed to
//be nonfatal but temporarily-brain-halting.

// 9904
//It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his brain to keep
//thinking of…

// 9905
//__…ways to hide from Death…__

// 9906
//A frown moved over Harry’s face. He’d heard something about that, somewhere.

// 9907
//__One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an excellent
//memory,__ Professor Quirrell had said.__ The key to a puzzle is often
//something you read twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you
//saw on the finger of a man you met only once…__

// 9908
//Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn’t remember, it was on the tip
//of his tongue but he couldn’t remember; so he told his subconscious to go on
//trying to recollect it, and refocused his attention on the other half of the
//problem.

// 9909
//__How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a Patronus Charm?__

// 9910
//The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from a few steps away,
//over and over throughout a whole day, and had come out of it looking merely
//tired. How had the Headmaster done that? Could Harry do it too?

// 9911
//It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry was screwed.
//But assuming the problem __was__ solvable…

// 9912
//Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn’t afraid of death.

// 9913
//Dumbledore __really__ wasn’t afraid of death. Dumbledore honestly, truly
//believed that death was the next great adventure. Believed it in his core, not
//just as convenient words used to suppress cognitive dissonance, not just
//pretending to be wise. Dumbledore had decided that death was the natural and
//normative order, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still in him, it had
//taken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementor to drain him through
//that small flaw.

// 9914
//That avenue was closed to Harry.

// 9915
//And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse question:

// 9916
//__Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other students didn’t
//fall over when they faced the Dementor.__

// 9917
//Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to live forever,
//if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death brought him no sense of
//despair or inevitability. He was not blindly attached to his own life; indeed
//it had taken an effort __not__ to burn away all his life on the need to
//protect others from Death. Why did the shadows of Death have such power over
//Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.

// 9918
//Was it Harry, all along, who’d been rationalizing? Who was secretly so afraid
//of death that it was twisting his own thoughts, as Harry had accused
//Dumbledore?

// 9919
//Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away. It felt
//uncomfortable, but…

// 9920
//But…

// 9921
//But uncomfortable thoughts weren’t always __true__, and this one didn’t
//sound exactly right. Like there was a grain of truth, but it wasn’t hiding
//__where__ the hypothesis said it was -

// 9922
//And that was when Harry realized.

// 9923
//__Oh.__

// 9924
//__Oh, I understand now.__

// 9925
//__The one who is afraid, is…__

// 9926
//Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.

// 9927
//And Harry’s Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the instant, for
//that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an unutterable fear that would do
//anything not to die, throw everything aside not to die, that couldn’t think
//straight or feel straight in the presence of that absolute horror, that
//couldn’t look into the abyss of nonexistence any more than it could have stared
//straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that only wanted to find a dark
//corner and hide and not have to think about it any more -

// 9928
//The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like a failing
//candle -

// 9929
//__It’s all right,__ thought Harry, __it’s all right.__

// 9930
//Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened child in his arms.

// 9931
//__It’s right and proper to be horrified, because death is horrible. You
//don’t have to hide your horror, you don’t have to feel ashamed of it, you can
//wear it as a badge of honor, openly in the Sun.__

// 9932
//It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the track of his
//thoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his thoughts that followed his
//dark side’s incomprehension at the alienness of the ordinary Harry’s thoughts;
//of all the things that his dark side associated with its own fear of death, the
//one thing it had never expected or imagined that it might find, was acceptance
//and praise and help…

// 9933
//__You don’t have to fight alone,__ Harry said silently to his dark side.
//__The rest of me will back you up on this. I won’t let myself die, and I
//won’t let my friends die either. Not you/I, not Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not
//Neville or Draco or anyone, this is the will to protect… __Visualizing wings of
//sunlight, like the wings of the Patronus he had spread, to give shelter to that
//frightened child.

// 9934
//The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or it was his own
//mind that was spinning?

// 9935
//__Take my hand,__ Harry thought and visualized, __come with me, and
//we will do this thing together…__

// 9936
//____

// 9937
//There was a lurch in Harry’s mind, like his brain had taken one step to the
//left, or the universe had taken one step to the right.

// 9938
//And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights far outshone by
//the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped Patronus, an invisible boy
//stood with a strange small smile on his face, shaking only slightly.

// 9939
//Harry knew, somehow, that he’d just done something significant, something that
//went beyond just strengthening his resistance to Dementors.

// 9940
//And more than that, he’d __remembered__. Thinking of Death as an
//anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough. Now Harry could
//remember it, what was reputed to hide someone from the gaze of Death himself…

// 9941
//In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard’s striding legs came to an abrupt halt; for
//the bright silver thing that was his guide, had halted in midair, fluttering
//its wings in distress. The brilliant white phoenix craned its head, looking
//backward and forward as though confused; and then it turned to its master and
//shook its head in apology.

// 9942
//Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the way he came.

// 9943
//Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him and around
//him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a little by the waves of
//emptiness that broke continually upon his unmoving stone, but his limbs were
//not cold, and his magic was with him. In time those waves might corrode him and
//consume him, sneaking through whatever tiny part of him still cowered before
//Death instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But that doom
//would take time, with the shadows of Death far away and uncaring of him. The
//flaw, the crack, the fault-line that was in him had been repaired, and the
//stars blazed brightly in his mind, vast and unafraid, and brilliant in the
//midst of cold and darkness.

// 9944
//To anyone else’s eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood alone in the
//dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange smile.

// 9945
//For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders were concealed by
//the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide
//its wearer from the gaze of Death himself. The riddle whose answer had been
//lost, and which Harry had found anew.

// 9946
//And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was more than the mere
//transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept you __hidden__ and
//not just invisible, as unseeable as were Thestrals to the unknowing. And Harry
//also knew that it was Thestral blood which painted the symbol of the Deathly
//Hallows on the inside of the Cloak, binding into the Cloak that portion of
//Death’s power, enabling the Cloak to confront the Dementors on their own level
//and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet a certain guess, the
//knowledge coming to him in the instant of solving the riddle.

// 9947
//Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry she was no
//longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to him as a Thestral. For
//Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given it; and he had comprehended and
//mastered the Deathly Hallow that had been passed down through the Potter line.

// 9948
//Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, “Can the Dementors reach
//you, Bella?”

// 9949
//“No,” said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, “But my Lord…
//__you__…”

// 9950
//“If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me,” Harry said coldly. “Or are you
//under the impression that I would sacrifice myself for you?”

// 9951
//“No, my Lord,” the Dark Lord’s servant replied, sounding puzzled, and perhaps
//awed.

// 9952
//“Follow,” spoke Harry’s cold whisper.

// 9953
//And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lord reached into his
//pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix had asked, Harry would have
//claimed it was for the chocolate, but she didn’t ask.

// 9954
//The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the silver and the
//red-golden phoenixes now following behind.

// 9955
//“__You -__” Amelia began to bellow.

// 9956
//“They have dismissed their Patronus,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard didn’t
//seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow overrode her own. “I cannot
//find them now.”

// 9957
//Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks on hold, and
//turned to the communications officer. “Tell the duty room to ask the Dementors
//__again__ if they can sense Bellatrix Black.”

// 9958
//The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment, and a few
//seconds later, looked up, surprised. “No -”

// 9959
//Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.

// 9960
//“- but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn’t a prisoner.”

// 9961
//“Fine!” snapped Amelia. “Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its kind are
//authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and anyone in their
//company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they’re to Kiss her immediately!”

// 9962
//Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to argue; but the
//old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held his peace.

// 9963
//Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted outside the window,
//conveying the Director’s orders.

// 9964
//The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his limbs, and then
//floated downward.

// 9965
//Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted in the central
//pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls of the vast metal
//structure that towered above them.

// 9966
//Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest of all
//creatures began their march of horror.
