//== Pretending to be Wise, Pt 1

// 7442
//Whistle. Tick. Bzzzt. Ding. Glorp. Pop. Splat. Chime. Toot. Puff. Tinkle.
//Bubble. Beep. Thud. Crackle. Whoosh. Hiss. Pffft. Whirr.

// 7443
//Professor Flitwick had silently passed Harry a folded parchment during Charms
//class that Monday, and the note had said that Harry was to visit the Headmaster
//at his convenience and in such fashion that no one else would notice,
//especially not Draco Malfoy or Professor Quirrell. His one-time password for
//the gargoyle would be “squeamish ossifrage”. This had been accompanied by a
//remarkably artistic ink drawing of Professor Flitwick staring at him sternly,
//the eyes of which occasionally blinked; and at the bottom of the note,
//underlined three times, was the phrase DON’T GET INTO TROUBLE.

// 7444
//And so Harry had finished up Transfiguration class, and studied with Hermione,
//and eaten dinner, and spoken with his lieutenants, and finally, when the clock
//struck nine, turned himself invisible and dropped back to 6PM and wearily
//trudged off toward the gargoyle, the turning spiral stairs, the wooden door,
//the room full of little fiddly things, and the silver-bearded figure of the
//Headmaster.

// 7445
//This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, the customary smile absent; and he
//was dressed in pajamas of a darker and more sober purple than usual.

// 7446
//“Thank you for coming, Harry,” said the Headmaster. The old wizard rose from
//his throne, began to slowly pace through the room and the strange devices.
//“First, do you have with you the notes of yesterday’s encounter with Lucius
//Malfoy?”

// 7447
//“Notes?” blurted Harry.

// 7448
//“__Surely__ you wrote it down…” said the old wizard, and his voice trailed
//off.

// 7449
//Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, if you’d just fumbled through a mysterious
//conversation full of significant hints you didn’t understand, the
//__bloody obvious__ thing to do would be to write it all down immediately
//afterward, before the memory faded, so you could try to figure it out later.

// 7450
//“All right,” said the Headmaster, “from memory then.”

// 7451
//Harry sheepishly recited as best he could, and got almost halfway through
//before he realized that it wasn’t smart to just go around telling the
//possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, at least not without __thinking__
//about it first, but then Lucius was __definitely__ a bad guy and
//Dumbledore’s opponent so it probably __was__ a good idea to tell him, and
//Harry had already started talking and it was too late to try and calculate
//things out now…

// 7452
//Harry finished his recollections honestly.

// 7453
//Dumbledore’s face had grown more remote as Harry went on, and at the end there
//was a look of ancientness about him, a sternness in the air.

// 7454
//“Well,” said Dumbledore. “I suggest you take the best of care that the heir of
//Malfoy does __not__ come to harm, then. And I will do the same.” The
//Headmaster was frowning, his fingers drumming soundlessly through the inky
//black surface of a plate inscribed with the word __Leliel.__ “And I think
//it would be most extremely wise for you to avoid __all__ interaction with
//Lord Malfoy henceforth.”

// 7455
//“__Did__ you intercept owls from him to me?” said Harry.

// 7456
//The Headmaster gazed at Harry for a long moment, then reluctantly nodded.

// 7457
//For some reason Harry wasn’t feeling as outraged as he should have been. Maybe
//it was just that Harry was finding it very easy to sympathize with the
//Headmaster’s point of view right now. Even Harry could understand why
//Dumbledore wouldn’t want him to interact with Lucius Malfoy; it didn’t seem
//like an __evil__ deed.

// 7458
//Not like the Headmaster blackmailing Zabini… for which they had only Zabini’s
//word, and Zabini was wildly untrustworthy, in fact it was hard to see why
//Zabini __wouldn’t__ just tell the story that got him the most sympathy
//from Professor Quirrell…

// 7459
//“How about if, instead of protesting, I say that I understand your point of
//view,” said Harry, “and you go on intercepting my owls, but you tell me who
//from?”

// 7460
//“I have intercepted a great many owls to you, I am afraid,” Dumbledore said
//soberly. “You are a celebrity, Harry, and you would receive dozens of letters a
//day, some from far outside this country, did I not turn them back.”

// 7461
//“__That__,” Harry said, now starting to feel a bit of indignation, “seems
//like going a little too far -”

// 7462
//“Many of those letters,” the old wizard said quietly, “will be asking you for
//things you cannot give. I have not read them, of course, only turned them back
//to their senders undelivered. But I know, for I receive them too. And you are
//too young, Harry, to have your heart broken six times before breakfast each
//morning.”

// 7463
//Harry looked down at his shoes. He __should__ insist on reading the
//letters and judging for himself, but… there was a small voice of common sense
//inside him, and it was screaming very loudly right now.

// 7464
//“Thank you,” Harry muttered.

// 7465
//“The other reason I asked you here,” said the old wizard, “was that I wished to
//consult your unique genius.”

// 7466
//“Transfiguration?” said Harry, surprised and flattered.

// 7467
//“No, not __that__ unique genius,” said Dumbledore. “Tell me, Harry, what
//evil could you accomplish if a Dementor were allowed onto the grounds of
//Hogwarts?”

// 7468
//It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather demanded, that his
//students test their skills against an actual Dementor after they learned the
//words and gestures to the Patronus Charm.

// 7469
//“Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm himself,” said
//Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices. “Which is never a good
//sign. But then, he __volunteered__ that fact to me in the course of
//demanding that outside instructors be brought in to teach the Patronus Charm to
//every student who wished to learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I
//would not. This impressed me greatly. But now he insists on bringing in a
//Dementor -”

// 7470
//“Headmaster,” Harry said quietly, “Professor Quirrell believes __very__
//strongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat conditions. Wanting to bring
//in an actual Dementor is __completely__ in character for him.”

// 7471
//Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.

// 7472
//“__In character?__” said the old wizard.

// 7473
//“I mean,” said Harry, “it’s entirely consistent with the way Professor Quirrell
//usually acts…” Harry trailed off. Why __had__ he put it that way?

// 7474
//The Headmaster nodded. “So you have the same sense I do; that it is an excuse.
//A very __reasonable__ excuse, to be sure; more so than you may realize.
//Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a Patronus Charm will succeed in the
//presence of an actual Dementor, going from not a single flicker of light to a
//full corporeal Patronus. Why this should be, no one knows; but it is so.”

// 7475
//Harry frowned. “Then I really don’t see why you’re suspicious -”

// 7476
//The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness. “Harry, the
//__Defense Professor__ has asked me to pass the darkest of all creatures
//through the gates of Hogwarts. I __must__ be suspicious.” The Headmaster
//sighed. “And yet the Dementor will be guarded, warded, in a mighty cage, I will
//be there myself to watch it at all times - I cannot think of what ill
//__could__ be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it. And so I am
//asking you.”

// 7477
//Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was so shocked he
//couldn’t even feel flattered.

// 7478
//“__Me?__” said Harry.

// 7479
//“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I try my best to anticipate my foes,
//to encompass their wicked minds and predict their evil thoughts. But __I__
//would never have imagined sharpening a Hufflepuff’s bones into weapons.”

// 7480
//Was Harry __ever__ going to live that down?

// 7481
//“Headmaster,” Harry said wearily, “I know it doesn’t sound good, but in all
//seriousness: I’m not evil, I’m just very creative -”

// 7482
//“I did not say that you were evil,” Dumbledore said seriously. “There are those
//who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil; but they are merely
//pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which does not know love, and dares
//not imagine love, and cannot ever understand love without ceasing to be evil.
//And I suspect that you can imagine your way into the minds of Dark Wizards
//better than I ever could, while still knowing love yourself. So, Harry.” The
//Headmaster’s eyes were intent. “If you stood in Professor Quirrell’s shoes,
//what misdeeds could you accomplish after you tricked me into allowing a
//Dementor onto the grounds of Hogwarts?”

// 7483
//“Hold __on__,” said Harry, and in something of a daze trudged over to the
//chair in front of the Headmaster’s desk, and sat down. It was a large and
//comfortable chair this time, not a wooden stool, and Harry could feel himself
//enveloped as he sank into it.

// 7484
//Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell.

// 7485
//Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of Dumbledore.

// 7486
//Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defense Professor was planning to do
//something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry __ought__ to be
//helping the Headmaster prevent it.

// 7487
//Point three…

// 7488
//“Headmaster,” Harry said, “if Professor Quirrell __is__ up to something,
//I’m not sure I __can__ outwit him. He’s got a lot more experience than I
//do.”

// 7489
//The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear very solemn despite
//his smile. “You underestimate yourself.”

// 7490
//That was the first time anyone had ever said __that__ to Harry.

// 7491
//“I remember,” the old wizard continued, “a young man in this very office, cold
//and controlled as he faced down the Head of House Slytherin, blackmailing his
//own Headmaster to protect his classmates. And I believe that young man is more
//cunning than Professor Quirrell, more cunning than Lucius Malfoy, that he will
//grow to be the equal of Voldemort himself. It is he who I wish to consult.”

// 7492
//Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name, frowned
//thoughtfully at the Headmaster.

// 7493
//__How much does he know…?__

// 7494
//The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious dark side, as deep
//as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still remembered what it had been like to
//watch, invisibly Time-Turned, as his past self faced down the older Slytherins;
//the boy with the scar on his forehead who didn’t act like the others.
//__Of course__ the Headmaster would have noticed something odd about the
//boy in his office…

// 7495
//And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning to match his
//destined foe, the Dark Lord.

// 7496
//Which wasn’t asking for very much, considering that the Dark Lord had put a
//clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants’ left arms, and that he’d
//slaughtered the entire monastery that taught the martial art he’d wanted to
//learn.

// 7497
//Enough cunning to match __Professor Quirrell__ would be a __whole__
//different order of problem.

// 7498
//But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry
//went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort of answer that sounded
//impressively cunning… which had better not __actually__ get in the way of
//Professor Quirrell’s teaching Defense…

// 7499
//And of course Harry __would__ go over to his dark side and think it
//through from that direction, just to be honest, and just in case.

// 7500
//“Tell me,” Harry said, “everything about how the Dementor is to be brought in,
//and how it is to be guarded.”

// 7501
//Dumbledore’s eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizard began to
//speak.

// 7502
//The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts by an Auror trio,
//all three personally known to the Headmaster, and all three able to cast a
//corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be met at the edge of the grounds by
//Dumbledore, who would pass the Dementor through the Hogwarts wards -

// 7503
//Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary - whether someone could just
//bring in the same Dementor again the next day.

// 7504
//The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approving nod), and the
//explanation went on: The Dementor would be in a cage of solid titanium bars,
//not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a Dementor’s presence would corrode
//that metal to dust, but not in a single day.

// 7505
//Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the Dementor, behind two
//corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the three Aurors at any given time.
//Dumbledore would wait by the Dementor’s cage with his Patronus. A single
//student would approach the Dementor; and Dumbledore would dispel his Patronus;
//and the student would attempt to cast their own Patronus Charm; and if they
//failed, Dumbledore would restore his Patronus before the student could suffer
//any permanent damage. Past dueling champion Professor Flitwick would also be
//present while there were students near, just to add safety margin.

// 7506
//“Why just __you__ waiting by the Dementor?” said Harry. “I mean, shouldn’t
//it be you plus an Auror -”

// 7507
//The Headmaster shook his head. “They could not withstand the repeated exposure
//to the Dementor, each time I dispel my Patronus.”

// 7508
//And if Dumbledore’s Patronus did fail for some reason, while one of the
//students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would cast another
//corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the student…

// 7509
//Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn’t see a flaw in the security.

// 7510
//So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed his eyes, and
//remembered:

// 7511
//__“And that will be… five points? No, let us make it an even ten points
//from Ravenclaw for backchat.”__

// 7512
//The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn’t been calling much
//on his dark side lately…

// 7513
//Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his mind, before his
//blood chilled into something approaching deadly crystalline clarity.

// 7514
//And then he thought of the Dementor.

// 7515
//And it was obvious.

// 7516
//“The Dementor is a distraction,” Harry said. The coldness clear in his voice,
//since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected. “A large, salient threat,
//but in the end straightforward, and easy to defend against. So while all your
//attention is focused on the Dementor, the real plot will be happening
//elsewhere.”

// 7517
//Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow nod. “Yes…” said
//the Headmaster. “And I do believe I know what it might be a distraction
//__from__, if Professor Quirrell means ill… thank you, Harry.”

// 7518
//The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in those ancient
//eyes.

// 7519
//“__What?__” said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold still lingering
//in his blood.

// 7520
//“I have another question for that young man,” said the Headmaster. “It is
//something I have long wondered to myself, yet been unable to comprehend.
//__Why?__” There was a tinge of pain in his voice. “Why would anyone
//deliberately make himself a monster? Why do evil for the sake of evil? Why
//Voldemort?”

// 7521
//__Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat…__

// 7522
//Harry stared at the Headmaster in surprise.

// 7523
//“How would __I__ know?” said Harry. “Am I supposed to magically understand
//the Dark Lord because I’m the hero, or something?”

// 7524
//“__Yes!__” said Dumbledore. “My own great foe was Grindelwald, and
//__him__ I understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the
//man I could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe
//that I was a good person, and therefore always in the right. __For the
//greater good__, that was his slogan; and he truly believed it himself, even as
//he tore at all Europe like a wounded animal. And him, I defeated in the end.
//But then after him came Voldemort, to destroy everything I had protected in
//Britain.” The hurt was plain now in Dumbledore’s voice, exposed upon his face.
//“He committed acts worse by far than Grindelwald’s worst, horror for the sake
//of horror. I sacrificed everything only to hold him back, and I still don’t
//understand __why!__ __Why__, Harry? Why did he do it? He was never my
//destined foe, but yours, so if you have any guesses at all, Harry, please tell
//me! __Why?__”

// 7525
//Harry stared down at his hands. The truth was that Harry hadn’t read up on the
//Dark Lord yet, and right now he hadn’t the tiniest clue. And somehow that
//didn’t seem like an answer the Headmaster wanted to hear. “Too many Dark
//rituals, maybe? In the beginning he thought he’d do just one, but it sacrificed
//part of his good side, and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark
//rituals, so he did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he
//ended up as a tremendously powerful monster -”

// 7526
//“No!” Now the Headmaster’s voice was agonized. “I can’t believe that, Harry!
//There has to be something more to it than just that!”

// 7527
//__Why should there be?__ thought Harry, but he didn’t say it, because it
//was clear that the Headmaster thought the universe was a story and had a plot,
//and that huge tragedies weren’t allowed to happen except for equally huge,
//significant reasons. “I’m sorry, Headmaster. The Dark Lord doesn’t seem like
//much of a dark mirror to me, not at all. There isn’t anything I find even the
//__tiniest__ bit tempting about nailing the skins of Yermy Wibble’s family
//to a newsroom wall.”

// 7528
//“Have you __no__ wisdom to share?” said Dumbledore. There was pleading in
//the old wizard’s voice, almost begging.

// 7529
//__Evil happens,__ thought Harry, __it doesn’t mean anything or teach
//us anything, except to not be evil? The Dark Lord was probably just a selfish
//bastard who didn’t care who he hurt, or an idiot who made stupidly avoidable
//mistakes that snowballed. There is no destiny behind the ills of this world; if
//Hitler had been allowed into architecture school like he wanted, the whole
//history of Europe would have been different; if we lived in the sort of
//universe where horrible things were only allowed to happen for good reasons,
//they just wouldn’t happen in the first place.__

// 7530
//And none of that, obviously, was what the Headmaster wanted to hear.

// 7531
//The old wizard was still looking at Harry from over a fiddly thing like a
//frozen puff of smoke, a painful desperation in those ancient, waiting eyes.

// 7532
//Well, sounding wise wasn’t difficult. It was a lot easier than being
//intelligent, actually, since you didn’t have to say anything surprising or come
//up with any new insights. You just let your brain’s pattern-matching software
//complete the cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdom you’d stored previously.

// 7533
//“Headmaster,” Harry said solemnly, “I would rather not define myself by my
//enemies.”

// 7534
//Somehow, even in the midst of all the whirring and ticking, there was a kind of
//silence.

// 7535
//That had come out a bit more Deeply Wise than Harry had intended.

// 7536
//“You may be very wise, Harry…” the Headmaster said slowly. “I do wish… that I
//could have been defined by my friends.” The pain in his voice had grown deeper.

// 7537
//Harry’s mind searched hastily for something else Deeply Wise to say that would
//soften the unintended force of the blow -

// 7538
//“Or perhaps,” Harry said more softly, “it is the foe that makes the Gryffindor,
//as it is the friend that makes the Hufflepuff, and the ambition that makes the
//Slytherin. I do know that it is always, in every generation, the puzzle that
//makes the scientist.”

// 7539
//“It is a dreadful fate to which you condemn my House, Harry,” said the
//Headmaster. The pain was still in his voice. “For now that you remark on it, I
//do think that I was very much made by my enemies.”

// 7540
//Harry stared at his own hands, where they lay in his lap. Maybe he should just
//shut up while he was ahead.

// 7541
//“But you __have__ answered my question,” said Dumbledore more softly, as
//though to himself. “I should have realized that would be a Slytherin’s key. For
//his ambition, all for the sake of his ambition; and __that__ I know,
//though not __why__…” For a time Dumbledore stared off into nothingness;
//then he straightened, and his eyes seemed to focus on Harry again.

// 7542
//“And you, Harry,” said the Headmaster, “you name yourself a
//__scientist?__” His voice was laced with surprise and mild disapproval.

// 7543
//“You don’t like science?” said Harry a little wearily. He’d hoped Dumbledore
//would be fonder of Muggle things.

// 7544
//“I suppose it is useful to those without wands,” said Dumbledore, frowning.
//“But it seems a strange thing by which to define yourself. Is science as
//important as love? As kindness? As friendship? Is it science that makes you
//fond of Minerva McGonagall? Is it science that makes you care for Hermione
//Granger? Will it be science to which you turn, when you try to kindle warmth in
//Draco Malfoy’s heart?”

// 7545
//__You know, the sad thing is, you probably think you just uttered some
//kind of incredibly wise knockdown argument.__

// 7546
//Now, how to phrase the rejoinder in such fashion that it also sounded
//incredibly wise…

// 7547
//“You are not Ravenclaw,” Harry said with calm dignity, “and so it might not
//have occurred to you that to respect the truth, and seek it all the days of
//your life, could also be an act of grace.”

// 7548
//The Headmaster’s eyebrows rose up. And then he sighed. “How did you become so
//wise, so young…?” The old wizard sounded sad, as he said it. “Perhaps it will
//prove valuable to you.”

// 7549
//__Only for impressing ancient wizards who are overly impressed with
//themselves,__ thought Harry. He was actually a bit disappointed by Dumbledore’s
//credulity; it wasn’t that Harry had __lied__, but Dumbledore seemed far
//too impressed with Harry’s ability to phrase things so that they sounded
//profound, instead of putting them into plain English like Richard Feynman had
//done with __his__ wisdom…

// 7550
//“Love is more important than wisdom,” said Harry, just to test the limits of
//Dumbledore’s tolerance for blindingly obvious cliches completed by sheer
//pattern matching without any sort of detailed analysis.

// 7551
//The Headmaster nodded gravely, and said, “Indeed.”

// 7552
//Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms. __Well, I’d
//better go off and love something, then, that’s bound to help me defeat the Dark
//Lord. And next time you ask me for advice, I’ll just give you a hug -__

// 7553
//“This day you have helped me much, Harry,” said the Headmaster. “And so there
//is one last thing I would ask that young man.”

// 7554
//__Great.__

// 7555
//“Tell me, Harry,” said the Headmaster (and now his voice sounded simply
//puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes), “why do Dark
//Wizards fear death so greatly?”

// 7556
//“Er,” said Harry, “sorry, I’ve got to back the Dark Wizards on that one.”

// 7557
//Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble -

// 7558
//“__What?__” said Dumbledore.

// 7559
//“Death is bad,” said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of clear
//communication. “Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of death is like being
//scared of a great big monster with poisonous fangs. It actually makes a great
//deal of sense, and does not, in fact, indicate that you have a psychological
//problem.”

// 7560
//The Headmaster was staring at him as though he’d just turned into a cat.

// 7561
//“Okay,” said Harry, “let me put it this way. Do you __want__ to die?
//Because if so, there’s this Muggle thing called a suicide prevention hotline -”

// 7562
//“When it is time,” the old wizard said quietly. “Not before. I would never seek
//to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it comes.”

// 7563
//Harry was frowning sternly. “That doesn’t sound like you have a very strong
//will to live, Headmaster!”

// 7564
//“Harry…” The old wizard’s voice was starting to sound a little helpless; and he
//had paced to a spot where his silver beard, unnoticed, had drifted into a
//crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that
//crept up the hairs. “I think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are
//not eager to live. They __fear death.__ They do not reach up toward the
//sun’s light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker caverns of
//their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life they desire, but
//__immortality;__ and they are so driven to grasp at it that they will
//sacrifice their very souls! Do you want to live __forever__, Harry?”

// 7565
//“Yes, and so do you,” said Harry. “I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will
//still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to live forever, proof by
//induction on the positive integers. If you don’t want to die, it means you want
//to live forever. If you don’t want to live forever, it means you want to die.
//You’ve got to do one or the other… I’m not getting through here, am I.”

// 7566
//The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of incommensurability.

// 7567
//“I have lived a hundred and ten years,” the old wizard said quietly (taking his
//beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake out the color). “I have seen
//and done a great many things, too many of which I wish I had never seen or
//done. And yet I do not regret being alive, for watching my students grow is a
//joy that has not begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that
//it does! What would you __do__ with eternity, Harry?”

// 7568
//Harry took a deep breath. “Meet all the interesting people in the world, read
//all the good books and then write something even better, celebrate my first
//grandchild’s tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first
//great-great-great grandchild’s hundredth birthday party around the Rings of
//Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of
//consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other
//stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on
//the other side of the Milky Way once we’ve explored the whole thing, meet up
//with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go out,
//and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran
//out of negentropy but I’m a lot more hopeful now that I’ve discovered the
//so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines.”

// 7569
//“I did not understand much of that,” said Dumbledore. “But I must ask if these
//are things that you truly desire so desperately, or if you only imagine them so
//as to imagine not being tired, as you run and run from death.”

// 7570
//“Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you’re allowed
//to die,” Harry said firmly. “It’s life, you just go on living it. If I’m not
//doing those things it’ll be because I’ve found something better.”

// 7571
//Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they touched it, the
//numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and the hands briefly appeared in
//different positions. “In the unlikely event that I am permitted to tarry until
//a hundred and fifty,” said the old wizard, “I do not think I would mind. But
//two hundred years would be entirely too much of a good thing.”

// 7572
//“Yes, well,” Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mum and
//Dad and __their__ allotted span if Harry didn’t do something about it, “I
//suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where people were
//accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundred would seem
//just as tragically premature as dying at, say, __eighty__.” Harry’s voice
//went hard, on that last word.

// 7573
//“Perhaps,” the old wizard said peacefully. “I would not wish to die before my
//friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The hardest time is when those
//you loved the most have gone on before you, and yet others still live, for
//whose sake you must stay…” Dumbledore’s eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing
//sad. “Do not mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with
//those I have long missed, on our next great adventure.”

// 7574
//“Oh!” Harry said in sudden realization. “You believe in an __afterlife__.
//I got the impression wizards didn’t have religion?”

// 7575
//Toot. Beep. Thud.

// 7576
//“__How can you not believe it?__” said the Headmaster, looking completely
//flabbergasted. ”__Harry, you’re a wizard! You’ve seen ghosts!__”

// 7577
//“Ghosts,” Harry said, his voice flat. “You mean those things like portraits,
//stored memories and behaviors with no awareness or life, accidentally impressed
//into the surrounding material by the burst of magic that accompanies the
//violent death of a wizard -”

// 7578
//“I’ve heard that theory,” said the Headmaster, his voice growing sharp,
//“repeated by wizards who mistake cynicism for wisdom, who think that to look
//down upon others is to elevate themselves. It is one of the silliest ideas I
//have heard in a hundred and ten years! __Yes,__ ghosts do not learn or
//grow, because this is __not where they belong!__ Souls are meant to move
//on, there is no life remaining for them __here!__ And if not ghosts, then
//what of the Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?”

// 7579
//“All right,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, “I’ll hear out your
//evidence, because __that’s what a scientist does.__ But first, Headmaster,
//let me tell you a little story.” Harry’s voice was trembling. “You know, when I
//got here, when I got off the train from King’s Cross, I don’t mean yesterday
//but back in September, when I got off the train then, Headmaster, I’d never
//seen a ghost. I wasn’t __expecting__ ghosts. So when I saw them,
//Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I __jumped to conclusions.__ I, I
//thought there __was__ an afterlife, I thought no one had ever really died,
//I thought that everyone the human species had ever lost was really fine after
//all, I thought that wizards could talk to people who’d passed on, that it just
//took the right spell to summon them, that wizards could __do__ that, I
//thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell them that I’d heard
//about their sacrifice and that I’d begun to call them my mother and father -”

// 7580
//“Harry,” whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old wizard’s eyes. He
//took a step closer across the office -

// 7581
//“And __then,__” spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his voice, the cold
//rage at the universe for being like that and at himself for being so stupid, “I
//asked Hermione and she said that they were just __afterimages,__ burned
//into the stone of the castle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettes
//left on the walls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should have known
//without even having to ask! I shouldn’t have believed it even for all of thirty
//seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn’t be any such thing as brain
//damage, if your soul could go on speaking after your whole brain was gone, how
//could damage to the left cerebral hemisphere take away your ability to talk?
//And Professor McGonagall, when she told me about how my parents had died, she
//didn’t act like they’d just gone away on a long trip to another country, like
//they’d emigrated to Australia back in the days of sailing ships, which is the
//way people would act if they __actually knew__ that death was just going
//somewhere else, if they had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making
//stuff up to console themselves, it would change __everything,__ it
//wouldn’t __matter__ that everyone had lost someone in the war, it would be
//a little sad but not __horrible!__ And I’d already seen that people in the
//wizarding world didn’t act like that! So I should have known better! And that
//was when I knew that my parents were really dead and gone forever and ever,
//that there wasn’t anything left of them, that I’d never get a chance to meet
//them and, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was
//__scared of ghosts -__”

// 7582
//The old wizard’s face was horrified, he opened his mouth to speak -

// 7583
//“So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But __don’t you
//dare__ exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because if you give me false hope
//again, and I find out later that you lied or stretched things just a little, I
//won’t ever forgive you for it! __What’s the Veil?__”

// 7584
//Harry reached up and wiped at his cheeks, while the glass things of the office
//stopped vibrating from his last shriek.

// 7585
//“The Veil,” said the old wizard with only a slight tremble in his voice, “is a
//great stone archway, kept in the Department of Mysteries; a gateway to the land
//of the dead.”

// 7586
//“And how does anyone know that?” said Harry. “Don’t tell me what you believe,
//tell me what you’ve __seen!__”

// 7587
//The physical manifestation of the barrier between worlds was a great stone
//archway, old and tall and coming to a sharp point, with a tattered black veil
//like the surface of a pool of water, stretched between the stones; rippling,
//always, from the constant and one-way passage of the souls. If you stood by the
//Veil you could hear the voices of the dead calling, always calling in whispers
//barely on the wrong side of comprehension, growing louder and more numerous if
//you stayed and tried to hear, as they tried to communicate; and if you listened
//too long, you would go to meet them, and in the moment you touched the Veil you
//would be sucked through, and never be heard from again.

// 7588
//“That doesn’t even sound like an __interesting__ fraud,” Harry said, his
//voice calmer now that there was nothing there to make him hope, or make him
//angry for having hopes dashed. “Someone built a stone archway, made a little
//black rippling surface between it that Vanished anything it touched, and
//enchanted it to whisper to people and hypnotize them.”

// 7589
//“Harry…” the Headmaster said, starting to look rather worried. “I can tell you
//the truth, but if you refuse to hear it…”

// 7590
//__Also not interesting. __ “What’s the Resurrection Stone?”

// 7591
//“I would not tell you,” the Headmaster said slowly, “save that I fear what this
//disbelief may do to you… so listen, then, Harry, please listen…”

// 7592
//The Resurrection Stone was one of the three legendary Deathly Hallows, kin to
//Harry’s cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call souls back from the dead -
//bring them back into the world of the living, though not as they were. Cadmus
//Peverell used the stone to call back his lost beloved from the dead, but her
//heart stayed with the dead, and not in the world of the living. And in time it
//drove him mad, and he killed himself to be truly with her once more…

// 7593
//In all politeness, Harry raised his hand.

// 7594
//“Yes?” the Headmaster said reluctantly.

// 7595
//“The obvious test to see if the Resurrection Stone is __really__ calling
//back the dead, or just projecting an image from the user’s mind, is to ask a
//question whose answer __you__ don’t know, but the dead person
//__would__, and that can be definitely verified in this world. For example,
//call back -”

// 7596
//Then Harry paused, because __this__ time he’d managed to think it through
//one step ahead of his tongue, fast enough to __not__ say the first name
//and test that had sprung to mind.

// 7597
//“…your dead wife, and ask her where she left her lost earring, or something
//like that,” Harry finished. “Did anyone do any tests like that?”

// 7598
//“The Resurrection Stone has been lost for centuries, Harry,” the Headmaster
//said quietly.

// 7599
//Harry shrugged. “Well, I’m a scientist, and I’m always willing to be convinced.
//If you __really__ believe the Resurrection Stone calls back the dead -
//then you must believe a test like that will succeed, right? So do you know
//anything about where to find the Resurrection Stone? I got __one__ Deathly
//Hallow already under highly mysterious circumstances, and, well, we both know
//how the rhythm of the world works on that sort of thing.”

// 7600
//Dumbledore stared at Harry.

// 7601
//Harry gazed equably back at the Headmaster.

// 7602
//The old wizard passed a hand across his forehead and muttered, “This is
//madness.”

// 7603
//(Somehow, Harry managed to stop himself from laughing.)

// 7604
//And Dumbledore told Harry to draw forth the Cloak of Invisibility from his
//pouch; at the Headmaster’s direction, Harry stared at the inside and back of
//the hood until he saw it, faintly drawn against the silvery mesh in faded
//scarlet like dried blood, the symbol of the Deathly Hallows: a triangle, with a
//circle drawn inside, and a line dividing them both.

// 7605
//“Thank you,” Harry said politely. “I shall be sure to keep an eye out for a
//stone so marked. Do you have any other evidence?”

// 7606
//Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself. “Harry,” the old
//wizard said, his voice rising, “this is a dangerous road you are walking, I am
//not sure I do the right thing by saying this, but I __must__ wrench you
//from this way! Harry, __how could Voldemort have survived the death of
//his body if he did not have a soul?__”

// 7607
//And __that__ was when Harry realized that there was exactly one person
//who’d __originally__ told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was
//still alive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their
//madhouse of a school, who thought the world ran on cliches.

// 7608
//“Good question,” Harry said, after some internal debate about how to proceed.
//“Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power of the Resurrection Stone,
//only he loaded it in advance with a __complete__ copy of his brain state.
//Or something like that.” Harry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to
//come up with an explanation for something that had __actually happened__.
//“Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know about how the
//Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill him?” __ If he even
//still exists as more than Quibbler headlines.__

// 7609
//“You are not fooling me, Harry,” said the old wizard; his face looked ancient
//now, and lined by more than years. “I know why you are truly asking that
//question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives
//you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord’s immortality in order to use it
//for yourself!”

// 7610
//“Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord’s immortality in order to use it for
//__everyone!__”

// 7611
//Tick, crackle, fzzzt…

// 7612
//Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and stared at Harry
//with his mouth gaping open dumbly.

// 7613
//(Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he’d managed to blow
//someone’s mind completely before the day was over.)

// 7614
//“And in case it wasn’t clear,” said Harry, “by __everyone__ I mean all
//Muggles too, not just all wizards.”

// 7615
//“No,” said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose. “No, no, no!
//__This is insanity!__”

// 7616
//“Bwa ha ha!” said Harry.

// 7617
//The old wizard’s face was tight with anger and worry. “Voldemort stole the book
//from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there when I went to look for it.
//But this much I know, and this much I will tell you: his immortality was born
//of a ritual terrible and Dark, blacker than pitchest black! And it was Myrtle,
//poor sweet Myrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took
//__murder -__”

// 7618
//“Well __obviously__ I’m not going to popularize a method of immortality
//that requires killing people! That would defeat the __entire point!__”

// 7619
//There was a startled pause.

// 7620
//Slowly the old wizard’s face relaxed out of its anger, though the worry was
//still there. “You would use no ritual requiring human sacrifice.”

// 7621
//“I don’t know what you take me for, __Headmaster,__” Harry said coldly,
//his own anger rising, “but let’s not forget that __I’m__ the one who wants
//people to __live!__ The one who wants to __save__ everyone!
//__You’re__ the one who thinks death is awesome and everyone ought to die!”

// 7622
//“I am at a loss, Harry,” said the old wizard. His feet once more began trudging
//across his strange office. “I know not what to say.” He picked up a crystal
//ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames, looked into it with a sad
//expression. “Only that I am greatly misunderstood by you… I don’t __want__
//everyone to die, Harry!”

// 7623
//“You just don’t want anyone to be immortal,” Harry said with considerable
//irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies like __All x: Die(x)
//= Not Exist x: Not Die(x)__ were beyond the reasoning abilities of the world’s
//most powerful wizard.

// 7624
//The old wizard nodded. “I am less afraid than I was, but still greatly worried
//for you, Harry,” he said quietly. His hand, a little wizened by time, but still
//strong, placed the crystal ball firmly back into its stand. “For the fear of
//death is a bitter thing, an illness of the soul by which people are twisted and
//warped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go down that bleak road,
//though I fear he has taken it further than any before him.”

// 7625
//“And you think __you’re__ not afraid of death?” Harry said, not even
//trying to mask the incredulity in his voice.

// 7626
//The old wizard’s face was peaceful. “I am not perfect, Harry, but I think I
//have accepted my death as part of myself.”

// 7627
//“Uh huh,” Harry said. “See, there’s this little thing called __cognitive
//dissonance,__ or in plainer English, __sour grapes.__ If people were hit on
//the heads with truncheons once a month, and no one could do anything about it,
//pretty soon there’d be all sorts of philosophers, __pretending to be
//wise__ as you put it, who found all sorts of __amazing benefits__ to being
//hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or
//it makes you happier on the days when you’re __not__ getting hit with a
//truncheon. But if you went up to someone who __wasn’t__ getting hit, and
//you asked them if they wanted to __start__, in exchange for those
//__amazing benefits,__ they’d say no. And if you __didn’t__ have to
//die, if you came from somewhere that no one had ever even __heard__ of
//death, and I suggested to you that it would be an __amazing wonderful
//great idea__ for people to get wrinkled and old and eventually cease to exist,
//why, you’d have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone
//possibly think any thought so silly as that death is a __good__ thing?
//Because you’re afraid of it, because you don’t __really__ want to die, and
//that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do
//something to numb the pain, so you won’t have to think about it -”

// 7628
//“No, Harry,” the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand trailed through
//a lighted pool of water that made small musical chimes as his fingers stirred
//it. “Though I can understand how you must think so.”

// 7629
//“Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?” Harry said, his voice now hard and
//grim. “Then look within the part of yourself that flees not from death but from
//the __fear__ of death, that finds that fear so unbearable that it will
//embrace Death as a friend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night
//so that it can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most
//terrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist that same
//part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it friendship. If you can
//call death better than life then you can twist your moral compass to point
//__anywhere -__”

// 7630
//“I think,” said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand to the sound
//of tiny tinkling bells, “that you understand Dark Wizards __very__ well,
//without yet being one yourself.” It was said in perfect seriousness, and
//without accusation. “But your comprehension of __me__, I fear, is sorely
//lacking.” The old wizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter in
//his voice.

// 7631
//Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from somewhere there
//was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of resentment, at Dumbledore’s
//condescension, and all the laughter that wise old fools had ever used in place
//of argument. “Funny thing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be
//this impossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he was a
//hundred times stronger than you.”

// 7632
//A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard’s face. “What do you mean?”

// 7633
//“I mean,” Harry said, his voice biting, “that Draco actually __took his
//own beliefs seriously__ and __processed__ my words instead of
//__throwing them out the window__ by smiling with gentle superiority.
//You’re so old and wise, you can’t even __notice__ anything I’m saying! Not
//understand, __notice!__”

// 7634
//“I __have__ listened to you, Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking more solemn
//now, “but to listen is not always to agree. Disagreements aside, what is it
//that you think I do not comprehend?”

// 7635
//__That if you __really__ believed in an afterlife, you’d go down to
//St. Mungo’s and kill Neville’s parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, so they
//could go on to their __next great adventure__, instead of letting them
//linger here in their damaged state -__

// 7636
//Harry barely, __barely__ kept himself from saying it out loud.

// 7637
//“All right,” Harry said coldly. “I’ll answer your original question, then. You
//asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster, that you
//__really__ believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify the
//existence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because
//they __knew__ their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine
//__destroying__ a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go
//on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that would
//be, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of the
//universe, which you would do anything to prevent from happening even once?
//Because __that’s __what Death really is - the annihilation of a soul!”

// 7638
//The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. “I suppose I
//__do__ understand now,” he said quietly.

// 7639
//“Oh?” said Harry. “Understand what?”

// 7640
//“Voldemort,” said the old wizard. “I understand him now at last. Because to
//believe that the world is truly like that, you must believe there is no justice
//in it, that it is woven of darkness at its core. I asked you why he became a
//monster, and you could give no reason. And if I could ask __him__, I
//suppose, his answer would be: Why not?”

// 7641
//They stood there gazing into each other’s eyes, the old wizard in his robes,
//and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.

// 7642
//“Tell me, Harry,” said the old wizard, “will __you__ become a monster?”

// 7643
//“No,” said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.

// 7644
//“Why not?” said the old wizard.

// 7645
//The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said:
//“There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in
//the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does
//not care. The stars don’t care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don’t have to!
//__We __care! There __is__ light in the world, and it is __us!__”

// 7646
//“I wonder what will become of you, Harry,” said the old wizard. His voice was
//soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. “It is enough to make me wish to
//live just to see it.”

// 7647
//The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the oaken door slammed
//shut behind him with a thud.
