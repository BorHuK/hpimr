-- Лайза Терпін!

//Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherin whisper whisper
//no seriously what the hell whisper whisper
Шепіт шепіт шепіт гаррі поттер шепіт шепіт слизерін шепіт шепіт шепіт ні серйозно

// 1602
//“RAVENCLAW!”
-- РЕЙВЕНКЛОВ!

// 1603
//Harry joined in the applause greeting the young girl walking shyly towards the
//Ravenclaw table, her robes’ trim now changed to dark blue. Lisa Turpin appeared
//torn between her impulse to sit down as far away from Harry Potter as possible,
//and her impulse to run over, forcibly insert herself at his side and start
//tearing answers out of him.
Гаррі приєднався до оплесків, якими вітали дівчинку, що соромʼязливо йшла до
рейвенкловського столу, її мантія тепер мала темно-синє оздоблення. Видавалося,
що Лайза Терпін розривалася між бажанням сісти якомога далі від Гаррі Поттера,
і бажанням вибороти місце поряд з ним і почати витягати з нього відповіді.

// 1604
//Being at the center of an extraordinary and curious event, and then being
//Sorted into House Ravenclaw, was closely akin to being dipped in barbecue sauce
//and flung into a pit of starving kittens.
Бути центральною фігурою надзвичайної й цікавої події, а потім бути
відсортованим до гуртожитку Рейвенклов, це ніби тебе вмочили у соус барбекю і
кинули до ями зі зголоднілими кошенятами.

// 1605
//“I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about it,” whispered Harry for the
//umpteenth time.
-- Я пообіцяв Сортувальному Капелюхові не розповідати про це, -- прошепотів Гаррі
сотий раз.

// 1606
//“Yes, really.”
-- Так, справді.

// 1607
//“No, I really did promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about it.”
-- Ні, я справді пообіцяв Сортувальному Капелюхові не розповідати про це.

// 1608
//“Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about __most__ of it and the
//rest is __private__ just like __yours was__ so __stop asking.__”
-- Гаразд, я пообіцяв не розповідати Сортувальному Капелюхові не розповідати про
__майже__ все з цієї розмови, а решта __особиста__ так само, як було __і в
тебе__, отже __припини питати.__

// 1609
//“You want to know what happened? Fine! Here’s part of what happened! I told the
//Hat that Professor McGonagall threatened to set it on fire and it told me to
//tell Professor McGonagall that she was an impudent youngster and she should get
//off its lawn!”
// hedrok: про lawn - копія з 1439
-- Хочеш знати, що сталося? Гаразд! От частина того, що сталося! Я сказав Капелюхові,
що професорка Макґонеґел погрожувала спалити його, а той сказав мені передати їй,
що вона нахабний підліток і хай вона забирається геть з його газону!

// 1610
//“If you’re not going to believe what I say then __why are you even
//asking?__”
-- Якщо ти не збираєшся вірити тому, що я кажу, то __навіщо ти взагалі питав?__

// 1611
//“No, I don’t know how I defeated the Dark Lord either! You tell me if you
//figure it out!”
-- Ні, я теж не знаю, як я переміг Темного Лорда! Обовʼязково розкажи мені,
коли дізнаєшся!

// 1612
//“__Silence!__” shouted Professor McGonagall at the podium of the Head
//Table. ”__No talking until the Sorting Ceremony finishes!__”
-- __Тиша!__ -- крикнула професорка Макґонеґел з подіуму головного столу. --
__Жодних розмов доки церемонію Сортування не завершено!__

// 1613
//There was a brief dip in the volume, as everyone waited to see if she was going
//to make any specific and credible threats, and then the whispers started up
//again.
Гучність ненадовго знизилася, доки всі чекали, чи збирається вона робити якісь
конкретні й вірогідні погрози, а потім перешіптування знову повернулися.

// 1614
//Then the silver-bearded ancient stood up from his great golden chair, smiling
//cheerfully.
Потім сріблобородий древній підвівся зі свого величезного золотого стільця,
весело усміхаючись.

// 1615
//Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry as he tried to continue a
//whisper, and Harry cut himself off in mid-sentence.
Миттєва тиша. Хтось несамовито штовхнув Гаррі, коли той спробував продовжити
шептати, і Гаррі на півслові обірвав себе.

// 1616
//The cheerful-looking old man sat down again.
Веселий стариган знову сів.

// 1617
//__Note to self: Do not mess with Dumbledore.__
__Примітка собі: Не займати Дамблдора.__

// 1618
//Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened during the
//Incident with the Sorting Hat. Not the least of which was what had happened the
//instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his head; in that moment, he’d heard a
//tiny whisper as though from nowhere, something that sounded oddly like English
//and a hiss at the same time, something that had said, “__Ssalutations
//from Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak to my
//ssnake.”__
Гаррі досі намагався обробити все, що було сталося в Пригоді з Сортувальним
Капелюхом. Вагомою частиною якої було те, що сталося одразу після того, як
Гаррі підняв Капелюха з голови; у ту мить він почув тихесенький шепіт, що
прозвучав ніби незвідки, і був схожим і на звичайну мову, і на шипіння
одночасно. Шепіт промовив: <<__Ссалют від Сслизерина до сслизеринця: якщо
шшукатимеш моїх таємницць, поговори зз моєю ззмією.__>>

// 1619
//Harry was sorta guessing that wasn’t supposed to be part of the official
//Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set down by Salazar
//Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that the Hat itself didn’t know
//about it. And that it was triggered when the Hat said “SLYTHERIN”, plus or
//minus some other conditions. And that a Ravenclaw like himself __really,
//really wasn’t supposed to have heard it__. And that if he could find some
//reliable way of swearing Draco to secrecy so he could ask him about it, that
//would be an excellent time to have some Comed-Tea handy.
Гаррі взагалі-то здогадувався, що це не частина офіційного процесу Сортування.
І що це було якесь додаткове закляття від Салазара Слизерина, що він наклав на
Капелюх під час створення. І що сам Капелюх не знав про це. І що воно
запускалося, коли капелюх казав <<СЛИЗЕРИН>>, плюс-мінус якісь додаткові умови.
І що жоден рейвенкловець __справді, справді не мав цього чути__. І що якби він
міг знайти якийсь надійний метод змусити Драко зберігати таємницю, щоб
розпитати про це, то було б чудовою нагодою випити пирсконаду.

// 1620
//__Boy, you resolve not to go down the path of a Dark Lord and the
//universe starts messing with you the instant the Hat comes off your head. Some
//days it just doesn’t pay to fight destiny. Maybe I’ll wait until tomorrow to
//start on my resolution to not be a Dark Lord.__
__Господи, ти вирішуєш не йти стежкою Темного Лорда, і всесвіт починає гратися
з тобою тілько-но ти знімаєш Капелюха з голови. У деякі дні боротьба з долею не
ладиться. Може вже завтра розпочну нищити в собі Темного Лорда.__

// 1621
//“GRYFFINDOR!”
-- ҐРИФІНДОР!

// 1622
//Ron Weasley got a __lot__ of applause, and not just from the Gryffindors.
//Apparently the Weasley family was widely liked around here. Harry, after a
//moment, smiled and started applauding along with the others.
Рон Візлі отримав __гучні__ оплески, і не лише від ґрифіндорців. Виявляється,
родина Візлі була доволі популярною тут. За мить Гаррі всміхнувся й почав
аплодувати разом з іншими.

// 1623
//Then again, there was no time like today to turn back from the Dark Side.
// @ Dark Side
З іншого боку, це саме сьогодні це може бути унікальною можливістю звернути з
Темної Сторони.

// 1624
//Stuff destiny and stuff the universe. He’d show that Hat.
До дідька долю й до дідька всесвіт. Він ще покаже Капелюхові.

// 1625
//“Zabini, Blaise!”
-- Блез Забіні!

// 1626
//Pause.
Пауза.

// 1627
//“SLYTHERIN!” shouted the hat.
-- СЛИЗЕРИН! -- вигукнув капелюх.

// 1628
//Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring the odd looks he was getting from everyone
//including Zabini.
Гаррі аплодував і Забіні, ігноруючи дивні погляди, що їх він отримував від усіх,
включно з Забіні.

// 1629
//No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that “Zabini,
//Blaise” did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great, so now he’d
//__only__ applauded Zabini… Oh well.

// 1630
//Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium. Apparently they
//were about to be treated to a speech -

// 1631
//And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a __brilliant__ experimental
//test.

// 1632
//Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard alive, right?

// 1633
//Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, “Comed-Tea”.

// 1634
//For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say something
//__so__ ridiculous during his speech that even in Harry’s state of mental
//preparedness, he would __still__ choke. Like, all the Hogwarts students
//had to not wear any clothes for the whole school year, or everyone was going to
//be transformed into cats.

// 1635
//But then if __anyone in the world__ could resist the power of the
//Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the Comed-Tea was
//literally __invincible.__

// 1636
//Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting to do this a
//bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise. A few heads turned to
//look at him, but soon turned back as -

// 1637
//“Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!” said Dumbledore, beaming at the
//students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more
//than to see them all there.

// 1638
//Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can again. He would
//swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to choke no matter __what__
//Dumbledore said -

// 1639
//“Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they
//are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank you!”

// 1640
//Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.

// 1641
//Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his mouth. He had, at
//least, managed to choke __quietly__.

// 1642
//He really really __really__ shouldn’t have done that. Amazing how
//much__ more obvious__ that became __one second __after it was__
//too late__.

// 1643
//In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrong when he was
//thinking about everyone being turned into cats… or even before then, remembered
//his mental note not to mess with Dumbledore… or his newfound resolution to be
//more considerate of others… or maybe if he’d had __one single scrap __of
//__common sense__…

// 1644
//It was hopeless. He was corrupt to the core. Hail the Dark Lord Harry. You
//couldn’t fight fate.

// 1645
//Someone was asking Harry if he was all right. (Others were starting to serve
//themselves food, which had magically appeared on the table, whatever.)

// 1646
//“I’m all right,” Harry said. “Excuse me. Um. Was that a… __normal__ speech
//for the Headmaster? You all… didn’t seem… very surprised…”

// 1647
//“Oh, Dumbledore’s insane, of course,” said an older-looking Ravenclaw sitting
//next to him who had introduced himself with some name Harry didn’t even begin
//to remember. “Lots of fun, incredibly powerful wizard, but completely bonkers.”
//He paused. “At some later point I’d also like to ask why green fluid came out
//of your lips and then disappeared, though I expect you promised the Sorting Hat
//not to talk about that either.”

// 1648
//With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at the
//incriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.

// 1649
//After all, the Comed-Tea hadn’t just arbitrarily __materialised__ a
//Quibbler headline about him and Draco. Draco had explained it in a way that
//made it seem like it had all happened… naturally? As if it had __altered
//history to fit?__

// 1650
//Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead against the table.
//__Wham, wham, wham__ went his head within his mind.

// 1651
//Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. “I hear that Dumbledore is
//secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of stuff and he uses the insanity
//as a cover so that no one will suspect him.”

// 1652
//“I’ve heard that too,” whispered a third student, and there were furtive nods
//from around the table.

// 1653
//This couldn’t help but catch Harry’s attention.

// 1654
//“I see,” whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. “So everyone knows that
//Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind.”

// 1655
//Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly thoughtful, including
//the older student sitting next to Harry.

// 1656
//__Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table?__ Harry managed not to ask out
//loud.

// 1657
//“Brilliant!” Harry whispered. “If everyone knows, no one will suspect it’s a
//secret!”

// 1658
//“Exactly,” whispered a student, and then he frowned. “Wait, that doesn’t sound
//quite right -”

// 1659
//__Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students a.k.a. Ravenclaw
//House is not the world’s most exclusive program for gifted children.__

// 1660
//But at least he’d learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea was
//omnipotent. And __that__ meant…

// 1661
//Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious connection.

// 1662
//…__that__ meant that as soon as he learned a spell to temporarily alter
//his own sense of humor, he could make __anything __happen, by making it so
//that he would __only__ find that __one thing__ surprising enough to
//do a spit-take, and then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.

// 1663
//__Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I expected this
//to take longer than my first day of school.__

// 1664
//Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts within ten minutes
//flat of getting Sorted.

// 1665
//Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this - Merlin knew what an
//insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven years of schooling - but he
//couldn’t __help__ feeling a twinge of pride, too.

// 1666
//Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was going to stop
//walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A prospect which was
//sounding scarier by the minute.

// 1667
//And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind was already
//visualising the minions’ uniforms.

// 1668
//“Eat,” the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed Harry in the
//ribs. “Don’t think. Eat.”

// 1669
//Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever was in front of
//him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits, whatever.

// 1670
//“What were you thinking about, the Sorting -” began to say Padma Patil, one of
//the other first-year Ravenclaws.

// 1671
//“No pestering during mealtimes!” chorused at least three people. “House Rule!”
//added another. “Otherwise we’d all starve around here.”

// 1672
//Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever new idea didn’t
//__actually__ work. And that the Comed-Tea worked some other way and didn’t
//__actually__ have the omnipotent power to alter reality. It wasn’t that he
//didn’t __want__ to be omnipotent. It was that he just couldn’t bear the
//thought of living in a universe that really worked like that. There was
//something __undignified__ about ascending through the clever use of fizzy
//drinks.

// 1673
//But he __was__ going to test it experimentally.

// 1674
//“You know,” said the older student next to him in a quite pleasant tone, “we
//have a system for forcing people like you to eat, would you like to find out
//what it is?”

// 1675
//Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite good,
//especially the glowing bits.

// 1676
//Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at least a little
//of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity couldn’t stand the thought of
//__not knowing__ how something tasted. Thank goodness this wasn’t a
//restaurant where you had to order only one thing and you never found out what
//all the other things on the menu tasted like. Harry __hated__ that, it was
//like a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity: __Find out
//about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha ha!__

// 1677
//Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely forgotten to leave
//room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit of treacle tart. Surely all
//these things would pass around at least once again over the course of the
//school year.

// 1678
//So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school things?

// 1679
//__To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the Comed-Tea
//and see whether you actually did figure out a path to omnipotence. Actually,
//just research every kind of mind magic you can find. Mind is the foundation of
//our power as humans, any kind of magic that affects it is the most important
//sort of magic there is.__

// 1680
//__To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2. Go through
//the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries, familiarising yourself
//with the system and making sure you’ve at least read all the book titles.
//Second pass: read all tables of contents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a
//much better memory than you. Find out if there’s an interlibrary loan system at
//Hogwarts and see if the two of you, especially Hermione, can visit those
//libraries too. If other Houses have private libraries, figure out how to access
//legally or sneak in.__

// 1681
//__Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start researching ‘From
//Slytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake.’
//Problem: This sounds highly confidential and it could take quite a while to
//randomly run across a book containing a hint.__

// 1682
//__To-do 0: Check out what sort of information-search-and-retrieval spells
//exist, if any. Library magic isn’t as ultimately important as mind magic but it
//has a much higher priority.__

// 1683
//__Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy to secrecy,
//or magically verify the sincerity of Draco’s promise to keep a secret
//(Veritaserum?), and then ask __him__ about Slytherin’s message…__

// 1684
//Actually… Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.

// 1685
//Now that Harry thought about it, he didn’t feel all that great about option 3a,
//either.

// 1686
//Harry’s thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of his life to date,
//those long seconds of blood-freezing horror beneath the Hat, when he thought
//he’d already failed. He’d wished then to fall back just a few minutes in time
//and change something, anything before it was too late…

// 1687
//And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.

// 1688
//Wish granted.

// 1689
//You couldn’t change history. But you could get it right to start with. Do
//something differently the __first__ time around.

// 1690
//This whole business with seeking Slytherin’s secrets… seemed an awful lot like
//the sort of thing where, years later, you would look back and say, ‘And
//__that__ was where it all started going wrong.’

// 1691
//And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back through time and
//make a different choice…

// 1692
//Wish granted. Now what?

// 1693
//Harry slowly smiled.

// 1694
//It was a rather __counterintuitive__ thought… but…

// 1695
//But he __could,__ there was no rule saying he couldn’t, he __could__
//just pretend he’d never heard that little whisper. Let the universe go on in
//exactly the same way it would have if that one critical moment had never
//occurred. Twenty years later, that was what he would desperately wish had
//happened twenty years ago, and twenty years before twenty years later happened
//to be right now. Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to think of
//it at the right time.

// 1696
//Or… this was even __more__ counterintuitive… he could even inform, oh,
//say, __Professor McGonagall,__ instead of Draco __or__ Hermione. And
//she could get a few good people together and get that little extra spell taken
//off the Hat.

// 1697
//Why, yes. That sounded like a __remarkably__ good idea once Harry had
//actually __thought__ of it.

// 1698
//So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and Option 3d just
//hadn’t occurred to him.

// 1699
//Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program.

// 1700
//It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him, but you couldn’t
//argue with the results on consequentialist grounds. It certainly did give him a
//better idea of the victim’s perspective, though.

// 1701
//__To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.__

// 1702
//Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up. __In every
//day, in every way, I’m getting Lighter and Lighter…__

// 1703
//People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this point, and the
//dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used plates.

// 1704
//When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up from his seat.

// 1705
//Harry couldn’t help but feel the urge to drink another Comed-Tea.

// 1706
//__You’ve GOT to be kidding,__ Harry thought at that piece of himself.

// 1707
//But the experiment didn’t count if it wasn’t replicated, did it? And the damage
//was already done, wasn’t it? Didn’t he want to see what would happen
//__this__ time? Wasn’t he __curious?__ What if he got a different
//result?

// 1708
//__Hey, I bet you’re the same part of my brain that pushed through the
//prank on Neville Longbottom.__

// 1709
//Er, maybe?

// 1710
//__And is it not __overwhelmingly__ obvious that if I do this I shall
//regret it one second after it is too late?__

// 1711
//Um…

// 1712
//__Yeah. So, NO.__

// 1713
//“Ahem,” said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long silver beard. “Just
//a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few
//start-of-term notices to give you.”

// 1714
//“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
//pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden Forest. If it were permitted it
//would be called the Permitted Forest.”

// 1715
//Straightforward. __Note to self: Forbidden Forest is forbidden.__

// 1716
//“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no
//magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Alas, we all know that
//what __should be__, and what __is__, are two different things. Thank
//you for keeping this in mind.”

// 1717
//Er…

// 1718
//“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
//interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. Anyone
//interested in reformulating the entire game of Quidditch should contact Harry
//Potter.”

// 1719
//Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just as all eyes
//turned towards him. How the __hell!__ He hadn’t met Dumbledore’s eyes at
//any point… he didn’t __think.__ He certainly hadn’t been thinking about
//Quidditch at the time! He hadn’t talked to anyone but Ron Weasley and he didn’t
//__think__ Ron would have told anyone else… or had Ron run off to a
//professor to complain? __How__ on __Earth…__

// 1720
//“Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
//right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
//painful death. It is guarded by an elaborate series of dangerous and
//potentially lethal traps, and you cannot possibly get past all of them,
//especially if you are only in your first year.”

// 1721
//Harry was numb at this point.

// 1722
//“And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell for heroically
//agreeing to undertake the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor
//at Hogwarts.” Dumbledore’s gaze moved searchingly across the students. “I hope
//all students will extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and
//__tolerance__ which is due his extraordinary service to you and this
//school, and that you __will not pester us__ with any __niggling
//complaints__ about him, unless __you__ want to try doing his job.”

// 1723
//What was __that__ about?

// 1724
//“I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor Quirrell, who would
//like to say a few words.”

// 1725
//The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the Leaky Cauldron
//slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing fearfully around in all
//directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the back of his head, and it looked like
//Professor Quirrell might already be going bald, despite his seeming youth.

// 1726
//“Wonder what’s wrong with __him,__” whispered the older-looking student
//sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed comments were being exchanged elsewhere
//along the table.

// 1727
//Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood there, blinking.
//“Ah…” he said. “Ah…” Then his courage seemed to fail him utterly, and he stood
//there in silence, occasionally twitching.

// 1728
//“Oh, great,” whispered the older student, “looks like another __long__
//year in Defence class -”

// 1729
//“Salutations, my young apprentices,” Professor Quirrell said in a dry,
//confident tone. “We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a certain
//__misfortune__ in its selections for this position, and no doubt many of
//you are already wondering what doom shall befall me this year. I assure you,
//that doom is not to be my incompetence.” He smiled thinly. “Believe it or not,
//I have long wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against
//the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The first
//to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin himself, and as late as the
//fourteenth century it was traditional for the greatest fighting wizards of
//every persuasion to try their hands at teaching here. Past Professors of
//Defence have included not just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but
//also the quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still
//shuddering at the sound of her name even though she’s been dead for six hundred
//years. That must have been an interesting time to attend Hogwarts, don’t you
//think?”

// 1730
//Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge of emotion that
//had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun speaking. The precise tones
//reminded him very much of a lecturer at Oxford, and it was starting to hit home
//that Harry wasn’t going to see his home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.

// 1731
//“You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by incompetents,
//scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense of history, it bears
//another reputation entirely. Not everyone who teaches here has been the best,
//but the best have all taught at Hogwarts. In such august company, and after so
//much time anticipating this day, I would be ashamed to set myself any standard
//lower than perfection. And so I do intend that every one of you will always
//remember this year as the __best__ Defence class that you have ever had.
//What you learn this year will forever serve as your firm foundation in the arts
//of Defence, no matter who your teachers before and after.”

// 1732
//Professor Quirrell’s expression grew serious. “We have a __great__ deal of
//lost ground to make up and not much time to cover it. Therefore I intend to
//depart from Hogwarts teaching conventions in a number of respects, as well as
//introducing some optional after-school activities.” He paused. “If that is not
//sufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you. You are my
//long-awaited students, and you __will__ do your __very__ best in my
//long-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of dreadful threat, like
//‘Otherwise you will suffer horribly’, but that would be so cliched, don’t you
//think? I pride myself on being more imaginative than that. Thank you.”

// 1733
//Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from Professor Quirrell.
//His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly found himself facing an unexpected
//audience, and he turned with a convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat,
//hunched over as if he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.

// 1734
//“He seems a little odd,” whispered Harry.

// 1735
//“Meh,” said the older-looking student. “You ain’t seen nothin’.”

// 1736
//Dumbledore resumed the podium.

// 1737
//“And now,” said Dumbledore, “before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!
//Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite words, and off we go!”
