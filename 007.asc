//Whoa. A spokesman for Rowling’s literary agent said that Rowling is okay with
//the existence of fanfiction as long as no one charges for it and everyone’s
//clear that the original copyrights belong to her? That’s really cool of her. So
//thank you, JKR, and thine is the kingdom!
// @ Whoa
Тпру. Представник літературного агента Ролінґ сказав, що Ролінґ не проти
існування фанфіків, доки ніхто не вимагає за них плату, і всім зрозуміло, що
оригінальні права належать їй? Це так класно з її боку. Отже дякую вам, ДжКР, і
нехай прийде царство твоє.

//I feel the need to disclaim that certain parts of this chapter are not meant as
//“bashing”. It’s not that I have a grudge, the story just writes itself and once
//you start dropping anvils on a character it’s hard to stop.
Мені хочеться заявити, що певні частини цього розділу не мають на меті
знущатися.  У не маю зуба, історія просто сама пишеться, і коли ти починаєш
кидати ковадла на персонажа, зупинитися важко.

// 718
//A few reviewers have asked whether the science in this story is real or made
//up. Yes, it is real, and if you look at my profile, you’ll see a link to a
//certain nonfiction site that will teach you pretty much everything Harry James
//Potter-Evans-Verres knows __and then some__.
Декілька рецензентів питали, наука в цьому творі справжня чи вигадана. Так, вона
справжня, якщо ви подивитися в мій профіль, то побачите посилання на певний сайт
не про художню літературу, де ви можете навчитися взагалі-то всьому, що знає
Гаррі Джеймс Поттер-Еванс-Веррес __і навіть більше__. (примітка перекладача: гадаю,
йдеться про https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences)

// 719
//Thank you very much to __all __my reviewers. (Especially Darkandus on
//Viridian Dreams, for the surprisingly inspiring comment “Lungs and tea are not
//meant to interact”.
Дуже дякую __всім__ рецензентам. (Особливо Darkandus на Viridian Dreams, за на
диво стимулюючий коментар ``Легені й чай не створені для взаємодії'').

//__“Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad.”__
__-- Твій тато майже такий саме класний, як мій.__

'''

// 721
//Petunia Evans-Verres’s lips were trembling and her eyes were tearing up as
//Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of the King’s Cross Station. “Are
//you sure you don’t want me to come with you, Harry?”
Губи Петунії Еванс-Веррес тремтіли, а очі наповнені сльозами, коли Гаррі обійняв
її на рівні поясу на платформі девʼять вокзалу Кінґс-Крос.

-- Ти впевнений, що не хочеш, щоб я пішов з тобою, Гаррі?

// 722
//Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was looking
//stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his mother, who really did
//look rather… uncomposed. “Mum, I know you don’t like the wizarding world very
//much. You don’t have to come with. I mean it.”
Гаррі поглянув на свого батька Майкла Верреса-Еванса, що цілковито відповідав
стереотипу непохитний-проте-гордий, а потім знову на матір, що була доволі...
розклеєною.

-- Мамо, я знаю, що ти не дуже полюбляєш чаклунський світи. Ти не зобовʼязана
зі мною йти. Чесно.

// 723
//Petunia winced. “Harry, you shouldn’t worry about me, I’m your mother and if
//you need someone with you -”
Петунія здригнулася.

-- Гаррі, ти не маєш турбуватися про мене, я твоя матір, і якщо тобі потрібно,
щоб хтось-

// 724
//“Mum, I’m going to be on my own at Hogwarts for __months__ and
//__months.__ If I can’t manage a train platform alone, better to find out
//sooner rather than later so we can abort.” He lowered his voice to a whisper.
//“Besides, Mum, they all love me over there. If I have any problems, all I need
//to do is take off my sweatband,” Harry tapped the exercise band covering his
//scar, “and I’ll have __way__ more help than I can handle.”
-- Мамо, я буду сам у Гоґвортсі __місяці__ й __місяці__. Я якщо я не впораюся з
залізничною платформою самостійно, то краще про це дізнатися якомога раніше,
щоб ми могли скасувати плани, -- він стишив голос до шепоту. -- Крім того,
мамо, вони всі мене тут люблять. Якщо в мене виникнуть будь-які проблеми, мені
достатньо буде просто зняти це з голови, -- Гаррі вказав на спортивну повʼязку
від поту, що прикривала його шрам, -- і мені нададуть __набагато__ більше
допомоги ніж потрібно.

// 725
//“Oh, Harry,” Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged him hard, face to
//face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry could feel her ragged
//breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob escape. “Oh, Harry, I do love you,
//always remember that.”
-- О, Гаррі, -- прошепотіла Петунія. Вона опустилася на коліна й сильно
обійняла його, цього разу їхні обличчя були на одному рівні, вони торкалися
щоками.  Гаррі відчував її нерівне дихання, а потім почув, як вона не втримала
приглушеного схлипування. -- О, Гаррі, я люблю тебе, завжди памʼятай про це.

// 726
//__It’s like she’s afraid she’ll never see me again, __the thought popped
//into Harry’s head. He knew the thought was true but he didn’t know why Mum was
//so afraid.
__Ніби вона боїться, що ніколи більше не побачить мене,__ -- спало Гаррі на
думку.  Він знав, що це може бути правдою, проте не знав, чому мама так
боїться.

// 727
//So he made a guess. “Mum, you know that I’m not going to turn into your sister
//just because I’m learning magic, right? I’ll do any magic you ask for - if I
//can, I mean - or if you want me __not__ to use any magic around the house,
//I’ll do that too, I promise I’ll never let magic come between us -”
Тому спробував здогадатися.

-- Мамо, ти ж знаєш, що я не перетворюся на твою сестру лише через те, що
вивчатиму магію, так? Я використаю будь-які чари, які попросиш -- якщо зможу,
звісно -- чи якщо ти хочеш, щоб я __не__ користувався магією біля дому, я й це
зроблю, я обіцяю, що не дам магії стати між нами-

// 728
//A tight hug cut off his words. “You have a good heart,” his mother whispered
//into his ear. “A very good heart, my son.”
Міцні обійми обірвали його слова.

-- У тебе добре серце, -- прошепотіла мати в його вухо. -- Дуже добре серце,
синку мій.

// 729
//Harry choked up himself a little, then.
Потім Гаррі ледь не задихнувся.

// 730
//His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchief out of her
//handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the running makeup around her
//eyes.
Мати відпустила його, і він підвівся. Вона дістала хустинку з сумочки, і
тремтячою рукою приклала навколо очей до макіяжу, що вже почав текти.

// 731
//There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the magical side
//of King’s Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking at Harry’s trunk
//directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael Verres-Evans couldn’t even walk.
// @ З останнім реченням зробив що міг...
Про те, щоб батько супроводжував його до магічної частини станції Кінґс Крос не
могло бути й мови. У тата були проблеми з тим, щоб навіть подивитися прямо на
валізу Гаррі. Магія -- це щось у крові, а в Майкла Верреса-Еванса цього не було
ані краплі.

// 732
//So instead his father just cleared his throat. “Good luck at school, Harry,” he
//said. “Do you think I bought you enough books?”
Отже натомість батько прочистив горло.

-- Хай щастить у школі, Гаррі, -- сказав він. -- Як гадаєш, я купив тобі
достатньо книжок?

// 733
//Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this might be his big
//chance to do something really revolutionary and important, and Professor
//Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his extremely busy schedule for two solid
//days in order to go on the Greatest Secondhand Bookshop Raid Ever, which had
//covered four cities and produced __thirty __boxes of science books now
//sitting in the cavern level of Harry’s trunk. Most of the books had gone for a
//pound or two, but some of them definitely __hadn’t,__ like the very latest
//__Handbook of Chemistry and Physics__ or the complete 1972 set of the
//__Encyclopaedia Britannica.__ His father had tried to block Harry off from
//seeing the till displays but Harry figured his father must have spent
//__at least__ a thousand pounds. Harry had said to his father that he would
//pay him back as soon as he figured out how to convert wizarding gold into
//Muggle money, and his father had told him to go jump in a lake.
Гаррі був пояснив батькові про те, що це з його точки зору може стати для нього
нагодою зробити щось справді революційне й важливе, і професор Веррес-Еванс був
кивнув, і відправив на смітник свій надзвичайно завантажений розклад на цілих
два дні, щоб піти на ``найбільший рейд по книгарнях зі вживаними книжками'', що
потребувало заїзду до чотирьох міст і призвело до появи __тридцяти__ коробок
наукових книжок, які тепер чекали в печерному рівні валізи Гаррі. Більшість
книжок можна було придбати за фунт чи два, проте деякі з них безсумнівно
__ні__, як найновіший ``Довідник з хімії й фізики'' чи всі томи ``Британської
енциклопедії'' 1972 року. Тато намагався був не дати Гаррі побачити суми на
касових апаратах, але Гаррі розумів, що батько мав витратити __принаймні__
тисячу фунтів. Гаррі був сказав татові, що поверне йому гроші, щойно зʼясує, як
обміняти золото чарівників на маґлівські гроші, а тато сказав був йому піти й
стрибнути в озеро.

// 734
//And then his father had asked him: __Do you think I bought you enough
//books?__ It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to hear.
І тоді батько був запитав його: __Як гадаєш, я купив тобі достатньо книжок?__
Було очевидним, яку відповідь хоче почути тато.

// 735
//Harry’s throat was hoarse, for some reason. “You can never have enough books,”
//he recited the Verres family motto, and his father knelt down and gave him a
//quick, firm embrace. “But you __certainly__ tried,” Harry said, and felt
//himself choking up again. “It was a really, really, __really__ good try.”
Гаррі чомусь охрип.

-- Книжок достатньо не буває, -- повторив він гасло родини Верресів, і тато присів
поряд з ним, щоб швидко й твердо обійняти його. -- Проте ти __безперечно__ спробував, --
сказав Гаррі, і йому знову бракувало повітря. -- Це була дійсно, дійсно, __дійсно__
гарна спроба.

// 736
//His Dad straightened. “So…” he said. “Do __you__ see a Platform Nine and
//Three-Quarters?”
Тато випростався.

-- Отже, -- сказав він. -- А __ти__ бачиш платформу девʼять і три чверті?

// 737
//King’s Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors paved with
//ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary people hurrying about
//their ordinary business, having ordinary conversations which generated lots and
//lots of ordinary noise. King’s Cross Station had a Platform Nine (which they
//were standing on) and a Platform Ten (right nearby) but there was nothing
//between Platform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin, unpromising barrier wall.
//A great skylight overhead let in plenty of light to illuminate the total lack
//whatsoever of any Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

// 738
//Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, __come on,
//mage-sight, come on, mage-sight__, but absolutely nothing appeared to him. He
//thought about taking out his wand and waving it, but Professor McGonagall had
//warned him against using his wand. Plus if there was another shower of
//multicoloured sparks that might lead to being arrested for setting off
//fireworks inside a train station. And that was assuming his wand didn’t decide
//to do something else, like blowing up all of King’s Cross. Harry had only
//lightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim was quite bizarre enough) in
//a very quick effort to determine what sort of science books to buy over the
//next 48 hours.

// 739
//Well, he had - Harry glanced at his watch - one whole hour to figure it out,
//since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven. Maybe this was the
//equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn’t become wizards. (And the
//amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine your Conscientiousness,
//which was the second most important factor in scholarly success.)

// 740
//“I’ll figure it out,” Harry said to his waiting parents. “It’s probably some
//sort of test thingy.”

// 741
//His father frowned. “Hm… maybe look for a trail of mixed footprints on the
//ground, leading somewhere that doesn’t seem to make sense -”

// 742
//“__Dad!__” Harry said. “Stop that! I haven’t even __tried__ to figure
//it out on my own!” It was a very good suggestion, too, which was worse.

// 743
//“Sorry,” his father apologised.

// 744
//“Ah…” Harry’s mother said. “I don’t think they would do that to a student, do
//you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn’t tell you anything?”

// 745
//“Maybe she was distracted,” Harry said without thinking.

// 746
//“__Harry!__” hissed his father and mother in unison. ”__What did you
//do?__”

// 747
//“I, um -” Harry swallowed. “Look, we don’t have time for this now -”

// 748
//“__Harry!__”

// 749
//“I mean it! We don’t have time for this now! Because it’s a really long story
//and I’ve got to figure out how to get to school!”

// 750
//His mother had a hand over her face. “How bad was it?”

// 751
//“I, ah,” __I can’t talk about that for reasons of National Security,__
//“about half as bad as the Incident with the Science Project?”

// 752
//“__Harry!__”

// 753
//“I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I’ll go ask them how to get
//in!” and Harry ran away from his parents towards the family of fiery redheads,
//his trunk automatically slithering behind him.

// 754
//The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. “Hello, dear. First time at
//Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too -” and then she peered closely at him. “__Harry
//Potter?__”

// 755
//Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and then froze in
//place.

// 756
//“Oh, __come on!__” Harry protested. He’d been planning to go as Harry
//Verres at least until he got to Hogwarts. “I bought a sweatband and everything!
//How come you know who I am?”

// 757
//“Yes,” Harry’s father said, coming up behind him with long easy strides, “how
//__do__ you know who he is?” His voice indicated a certain dread.

// 758
//“Your picture was in the newspapers,” said one of two identical-looking twins.

// 759
//“__HARRY!__”

// 760
//“__Dad!__ It’s not like that! It’s ‘cause I defeated the Dark Lord
//You-Know-Who when I was one year old!”

// 761
//“__WHAT?__”

// 762
//“Mum can explain.”

// 763
//“__WHAT?__”

// 764
//“Ah… Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would be best not to
//bother you with until now -”

// 765
//“Excuse me,” Harry said to the redheaded family who were all staring at him,
//“but it would be quite extremely helpful if you could tell me how to get to
//Platform Nine and Three Quarters __right now__.”

// 766
//“Ah…” said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the wall between
//platforms. “Just walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
//Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important.
//Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.”

// 767
//“And whatever you do, don’t think of an elephant.”

// 768
//“__George!__ Ignore him, Harry dear, there’s no reason not to think of an
//elephant.”

// 769
//“I’m Fred, Mum, not George -”

// 770
//“Thanks!” Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier -

// 771
//Wait a minute, it wouldn’t work __unless he believed in it?__

// 772
//It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually working fast
//enough to realise that this was a case where “resonant doubt” applied, that is,
//if he’d started out thinking that he would go through the barrier he’d have
//been fine, only now he was worried about whether he sufficiently
//__believed__ he’d go through the barrier, which meant that he actually
//__was__ worried about crashing into it -

// 773
//“__Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to do!__” That was his
//Dad.

// 774
//Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about justified credibility
//and just tried to believe __really hard__ that he’d go through the barrier
//and -

// 775
//- the sounds around him changed.

// 776
//Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely dirtied by having
//made a deliberate effort to believe something.

// 777
//He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single huge train,
//fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive scarlet-metal steam engine with
//a tall chimney that promised death to air quality. The platform was already
//lightly crowded (even though Harry was a full hour early); dozens of children
//and their parents swarmed around benches, tables, and various hawkers and
//stalls.

// 778
//It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in King’s Cross
//Station and no room to hide it.

// 779
//__Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else entirely (b) they
//can fold space like no one’s business or (c) they are simply ignoring all the
//rules.__

// 780
//There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned around to observe
//that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small clawed tentacles.
//Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had also managed to believe with
//sufficient strength to pass through the barrier. That was actually a little
//disturbing when Harry started thinking about it.

// 781
//A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came through the iron
//archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind him on a lead and
//nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid for having stayed around,
//quickly began moving away from the landing area, and the red-haired boy
//followed him, yanking hard on his trunk’s lead in order to keep up. A moment
//later, a white owl fluttered through the archway and came to rest on the boy’s
//shoulder.

// 782
//“Cor,” said the red-haired boy, “are you __really__ Harry Potter?”

// 783
//__Not this again.__ “I have no logical way of knowing that for certain. My
//parents raised me to __believe__ that my name was Harry James
//Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told me that I __look__
//like my parents, I mean my other parents, but,” Harry frowned, realising, “for
//all __I__ know, there could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a
//specified appearance -”

// 784
//“Er, what, mate?”

// 785
//__Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it.__ “Yes, I’m Harry Potter.”

// 786
//“I’m Ron Weasley,” said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid, and stuck out
//a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked. The owl gave Harry an oddly
//measured and courteous hoot (actually more of an eehhhhh sound, which surprised
//Harry).

// 787
//At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent catastrophe. “Just a
//second,” he said to Ron, and opened one of the drawers of his trunk, the one
//that if he recalled correctly was for Winter Clothes - it was - and then he
//found the lightest scarf he owned, underneath his winter coat. Harry took off
//his sweatband, and just as quickly unfolded the scarf and tied it around his
//face. It was a little hot, especially in the summer, but Harry could live with
//that.

// 788
//Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drew forth black
//wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now that he was out of Muggle
//territory.

// 789
//“There,” Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through the scarf over
//his face. He turned to Ron. “How do I look? Stupid, I know, but am I
//identifiable as Harry Potter?”

// 790
//“Er,” Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. “Not really, Harry.”

// 791
//“Very good,” Harry said. “However, so as not to obviate the point of the whole
//exercise, you will henceforth address me as,” Verres might not work anymore,
//“Mr. Spoo.”

// 792
//“Okay, Harry,” Ron said uncertainly.

// 793
//__The Force is not particularly strong in this one.__ “Call… me… Mister…
//Spoo.”

// 794
//“Okay, Mister Spoo -” Ron stopped. “I can’t do that, it makes me feel stupid.”

// 795
//__That’s not just a feeling.__ “Okay. __You__ pick a name.”

// 796
//“Mr. Cannon,” Ron said at once. “For the Chudley Cannons.”

// 797
//“Ah…” Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this. “Who or what are
//the Chudley Cannons?”

// 798
//“__Who’re the Chudley Cannons?__ Only the most brilliant team in the whole
//history of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the bottom of the league last
//year, but -”

// 799
//“What’s Quidditch?”

// 800
//Asking this was also a mistake.

// 801
//“So let me get this straight,” Harry said as it seemed that Ron’s explanation
//(with associated hand gestures) was winding down. “Catching the Snitch is worth
//__one hundred and fifty points?__”

// 802
//“Yeah -”

// 803
//“How many ten-point goals does one side usually score __not__ counting the
//Snitch?”

// 804
//“Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games -”

// 805
//“That’s just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game design. Look, the
//rest of this game sounds like it might make sense, sort of, for a sport I mean,
//but you’re basically saying that catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any
//ordinary point spread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for
//the Snitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the Snitch
//first is going to be mostly luck -”

// 806
//“It’s not luck!” protested Ron. “You’ve got to keep your eyes moving in the
//right pattern -”

// 807
//“That’s not __interactive,__ there’s no back-and-forth with the other
//player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly good at moving their
//eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky swoops in and grabs the Snitch and
//makes everyone else’s work moot. It’s like someone took a real game and grafted
//on this pointless extra position so that you could be the Most Important Player
//without needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who was the
//first Seeker, the King’s idiot son who wanted to play Quidditch but couldn’t
//understand the rules?” Actually, now that Harry thought about it, that seemed
//like a surprisingly good hypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to
//catch the shiny thing…

// 808
//Ron’s face pulled into a scowl. “If you don’t like Quidditch, you don’t have to
//make fun of it!”

// 809
//“If you can’t criticise, you can’t optimise. I’m suggesting how to
//__improve the game.__ And it’s very simple. Get rid of the Snitch.”

// 810
//“They won’t change the game just ‘cause __you__ say so!”

// 811
//“I __am__ the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to me. And maybe
//if I can persuade them to change the game at Hogwarts, the innovation will
//spread.”

// 812
//A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron’s face. “But, but if you get
//rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the game ends?”

// 813
//“__Buy… a… clock.__ It would be a lot fairer than having the game
//sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not end for hours, and the
//schedule would be a lot more predictable for the spectators, too.” Harry
//sighed. “Oh, stop giving me that look of absolute horror, I probably won’t
//__actually__ take the time to destroy this pathetic excuse for a national
//sport and remake it stronger and smarter in my own image. I’ve got way, way,
//__way__ more important stuff to worry about.” Harry looked thoughtful.
//“Then again, it wouldn’t __take__ much time to write up the Ninety-Five
//Theses of the Snitchless Reformation and nail it to a church door -”

// 814
//“Potter,” drawled a young boy’s voice, “__what__ is that on your face and
//__what__ is standing next to you?”

// 815
//Ron’s look of horror was replaced by utter hatred. “__You!__”

// 816
//Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who might have been
//forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up for that with a trunk
//looking at least as magical and far more elegant than Harry’s own, decorated in
//silver and emeralds and bearing what Harry guessed to be the Malfoy family
//crest, a beautiful fanged serpent over crossed ivory wands.

// 817
//“Draco!” Harry said. “Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that kind of sounds
//like Lucius to me. I’m glad to see you’re doing so well after, um, our last
//meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I’m trying to go incognito, so call me, eh,”
//Harry looked down at his robes, “Mister Black.”

// 818
//“__Harry!__” hissed Ron. “You can’t use __that__ name!”

// 819
//Harry blinked. “Why not?” It __sounded__ nicely dark, like an
//international man of mystery -

// 820
//“I’d say it’s a __fine__ name,” said Draco, “but it belongs to the Noble
//and Most Ancient House of Black. I’ll call you Mr. Silver.”

// 821
//“__You__ get away from… from Mr. Gold,” Ron said coldly, and took a
//forward step. “He doesn’t need to talk to the likes of you!”

// 822
//Harry raised a placating hand. “I’ll go by Mr. Bronze, thanks for the naming
//schema. And, Ron, um,” Harry struggled to find a way to say this, “I’m glad
//you’re so… enthusiastic about protecting me, but I don’t particularly mind
//talking to Draco -”

// 823
//This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry with eyes now
//aflame with outrage. “__What?__ Do you __know__ who this is?”

// 824
//“Yes, Ron,” Harry said, “you may remember that I called him Draco without him
//needing to introduce himself.”

// 825
//Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron’s shoulder. “Oh,
//what’s __this?__” Draco said in a drawl rich with malice. “Where’s the
//famous Weasley family rat?”

// 826
//“Buried in the backyard,” Ron said coldly.

// 827
//“Aw, how sad. Pot… ah, Mr. Bronze, I should mention that the Weasley family is
//widely agreed to have __the best pet story ever__. Want to tell it,
//Weasley?”

// 828
//Ron’s face contorted. “You wouldn’t think it was funny if it happened to
//__your__ family!”

// 829
//“Oh,” Draco purred, “but it wouldn’t ever __happen__ to the Malfoys.”

// 830
//Ron’s hands clenched into fists -

// 831
//“That’s enough,” Harry said, putting as much quiet authority into the voice as
//he could manage. It was clear that whatever this was about, it was a painful
//memory for the red-haired kid. “If Ron doesn’t want to talk about it, he
//doesn’t have to talk about it, and I’d ask that you not talk about it either.”

// 832
//Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. “That’s right, Harry! I
//mean Mr. Bronze! You see what kind of person he is? Now tell him to go away!”

// 833
//Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very quick
//__12345678910 __- an odd habit left over from the age of five when his
//mother had first instructed him to do it, and Harry had reasoned that his way
//was faster and ought to be just as effective. “I’m not telling him to go away,”
//Harry said calmly. “He’s welcome to talk to me if he wants.”

// 834
//“Well, I don’t intend to hang around with anyone who hangs around with Draco
//Malfoy,” Ron announced coldly.

// 835
//Harry shrugged. “That’s up to you. __I__ don’t intend to let anyone say
//who I can and can’t hang around with.” Silently chanting, __please go
//away, please go away…__

// 836
//Ron’s face went blank with surprise, like he’d actually expected that line to
//work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage’s lead and stormed off down the
//platform.

// 837
//“If you didn’t like him,” Draco said curiously, “why didn’t you just walk
//away?”

// 838
//“Um… his mother helped me figure out how to get to this platform from the
//King’s Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to tell him to get lost. And it’s
//not that I __hate__ this Ron guy,” Harry said, “I just, just…” Harry
//searched for words.

// 839
//“Don’t see any reason for him to exist?” offered Draco.

// 840
//“Pretty much.”

// 841
//“Anyway, Potter… if you really were raised by Muggles -” Draco paused here, as
//if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn’t say anything “- then you mightn’t
//know what it’s like to be famous. People want to take up __all__ of our
//time. You __have__ to learn to say no.”

// 842
//Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. “That sounds like good
//advice.”

// 843
//“If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time with the
//pushiest ones. Decide who you __want__ to spend time with and make
//everyone else leave. You’re just getting here, Potter, so everyone’s going to
//judge you by who they see you with, and you don’t want to be seen with the
//likes of Ron Weasley.”

// 844
//Harry nodded again. “If you don’t mind my asking, how did you recognise me?”

// 845
//“__Mister Bronze__,” Draco drawled, “I __have__ met you, remember. I
//saw someone going around with a scarf wrapped around his head, looking
//absolutely ridiculous. So I took a __guess.__”

// 846
//Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. “I’m __terribly__ sorry
//about that,” Harry said. “Our first meeting, I mean. I didn’t mean to embarrass
//you in front of Lucius.”

// 847
//Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. “I just wish Father could
//have come in while __you__ were flattering __me__ -” Draco laughed.
//“But thank __you__ for what you said to Father. If not for that, I
//might’ve had a harder time explaining.”

// 848
//Harry swept a deeper bow. “And thank __you__ for reciprocating with what
//you said to Professor McGonagall.”

// 849
//“You’re welcome. Though one of the assistants must’ve sworn her closest friend
//to absolute secrecy, because Father says there’re __weird rumors__ going
//around, like you and I got in a fight or something.”

// 850
//“Ouch,” Harry said, wincing. “I’m __really__ sorry -”

// 851
//“No, we’re used to it, Merlin knows there’s lots of rumors about the Malfoy
//family already.”

// 852
//Harry nodded. “I’m glad to hear you’re not in trouble.”

// 853
//Draco smirked. “Father has, um, a __refined__ sense of humor, but he
//__does__ understand making friends. He understands it __very__ well.
//He made me repeat that before I went to bed every night for the last month, ‘I
//will make friends at Hogwarts.’ When I explained everything to him and he saw
//that’s what I was doing, he bought me an ice-cream.”

// 854
//Harry’s jaw dropped. “__You managed to spin that into an ice-cream?__”

// 855
//Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved. “Well, father
//__knew__ what I was doing, of course, but he’s the one who taught me
//__how__ to do it, and if I grin the right way __while__ I’m doing it,
//that makes it a father-son thing and then he __has__ to buy me an
//ice-cream or I’ll give him this sort of sad look, like I think I must have
//disappointed him.”

// 856
//Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another master. “You’ve
//had __lessons__ on how to manipulate people?”

// 857
//“Of course,” Draco said proudly. “I’m a __Malfoy.__ Father bought me
//tutors.”

// 858
//“Wow,” Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini’s __Influence: Science and
//Practice__ probably didn’t stack up very high compared to that (though it was
//still one heck of a book). “Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad.”

// 859
//Draco’s eyebrows rose loftily. “Oh? And what does __your__ father do?”

// 860
//“He buys me books.”

// 861
//Draco considered this. “That doesn’t sound very impressive.”

// 862
//“You had to be there. Anyway, I’m glad to hear all that. The way Lucius was
//looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify you.”

// 863
//“My father really loves me,” Draco said firmly. “He wouldn’t ever do that.”

// 864
//“Um…” Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired figure of
//elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin’s, wielding that beautiful,
//deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn’t easy to visualise him as a doting father.
//“Don’t take this the wrong way, but how do you __know__ that?”

// 865
//“Huh?” It was clear that this was a question Draco did not commonly ask
//himself.

// 866
//“I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believe what you
//believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? What
//makes you think Lucius wouldn’t sacrifice you the same way he’d sacrifice
//anything else for power?”

// 867
//Draco shot Harry another odd look. “Just what do __you__ know about
//Father?”

// 868
//“Um… seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts’ Board of Governors, incredibly
//wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has the confidence of Minister Fudge,
//probably has some highly embarrassing photos of Minister Fudge, most prominent
//blood purist now that the Dark Lord’s gone, former Death Eater who was found to
//have the Dark Mark but got off by claiming to be under the Imperius Curse,
//which was ridiculously implausible and pretty much everyone knew it… evil with
//a capital ‘E’ and a born killer… I think that’s it.”

// 869
//Draco’s eyes had narrowed to slits. “McGonagall told you that, did she.”

// 870
//“No, she wouldn’t say __anything__ to me about Lucius afterwards, except
//to stay away from him. So during the Incident at the Potions Shop, while
//Professor McGonagall was busy yelling at the shopkeeper and trying to get
//everything under control, I grabbed one of the customers and asked
//__them__ about Lucius.”

// 871
//Draco’s eyes were wide again. “Did you __really?__”

// 872
//Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. “If I lied the first time, I’m not going to
//tell you the truth just because you ask twice.”

// 873
//There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this.

// 874
//“You’re so completely going to be in Slytherin.”

// 875
//“I’m so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very much. I only want
//power so I can get books.”

// 876
//Draco giggled. “Yeah, right. Anyway… to answer what you asked…” Draco took a
//deep breath, and his face turned serious. “Father once missed a Wizengamot vote
//for me. I was on a broom and I fell off and broke a lot of ribs. It really
//hurt. I’d never hurt that much before and I thought I was going to die. So
//Father missed this really important vote, because he was there by my bed at St.
//Mungo’s, holding my hands and promising me that I was going to be okay.”

// 877
//Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced himself to look
//back at Draco. “Why are you telling me __that?__ It seems sort of…
//private…”

// 878
//Draco gave Harry a serious look. “One of my tutors once said that people form
//close friendships by knowing private things about each other, and the reason
//most people don’t make close friends is because they’re too embarrassed to
//share anything really important about themselves.” Draco turned his palms out
//invitingly. “Your turn?”

// 879
//Knowing that Draco’s hopeful face had probably been drilled into him by months
//of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry observed. Actually it
//__did__ make it __less__ effective, but unfortunately not
//__ineffective.__ The same could be said of Draco’s clever use of
//reciprocation pressure for an unsolicited gift, a technique which Harry had
//read about in his social psychology books (one experiment had shown that an
//unconditional gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50
//in getting people to fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited gift of a
//confidence, and now invited Harry to offer a confidence in return… and the
//thing was, Harry __did__ feel pressured. Refusal, Harry was certain, would
//be met with a look of sad disappointment, and maybe a small amount of contempt
//indicating that Harry had lost points.

// 880
//“Draco,” Harry said, “just so you know, I recognise exactly what you’re doing
//right now. My own books called it __reciprocation__ and they talk about
//how giving someone a straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as
//effective as offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you want…”
//Harry trailed off.

// 881
//Draco was looking sad and disappointed. “It’s not meant as a trick, Harry. It’s
//a real way of becoming friends.”

// 882
//Harry held up a hand. “I didn’t say I wasn’t going to respond. I just need time
//to pick something that’s private but just as non-damaging. Let’s say… I wanted
//you to know that I can’t be rushed into things.” A pause to reflect could go a
//long way in defusing the power of a lot of compliance techniques, once you
//learned to recognise them for what they were.

// 883
//“All right,” Draco said. “I’ll wait while you come up with something. Oh, and
//please take off the scarf while you say it.”

// 884
//__Simple but effective.__

// 885
//And Harry couldn’t help but notice how clumsy, awkward, graceless his attempt
//at resisting manipulation / saving face / showing off had appeared compared to
//Draco. __I need those tutors.__

// 886
//“All right,” Harry said after a time. “Here’s mine.” He glanced around and then
//rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing everything but the scar. “Um…
//it sounds like you can really rely on your father. I mean… if you talk to him
//seriously, he’ll always listen to you and take you seriously.”

// 887
//Draco nodded.

// 888
//“Sometimes,” Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly hard, but then it
//was meant to be. “Sometimes I wish my own Dad was like yours.” Harry’s eyes
//flinched away from Draco’s face, more or less automatically, and then Harry
//forced himself to look back at Draco.

// 889
//Then it hit Harry __what on Earth he’d just said__, and Harry hastily
//added, “Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless instrument of death like Lucius,
//I only mean taking me seriously -”

// 890
//“I understand,” Draco said with a smile. “There… now doesn’t it feel like we’re
//a little closer to being friends?”

// 891
//Harry nodded. “Yeah. It does, actually. Um… no offence, but I’m going to put on
//my disguise again, I __really__ don’t want to deal with -”

// 892
//“I understand.”

// 893
//Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face.

// 894
//“My father takes all his friends seriously,” Draco said. “That’s why he has
//lots of friends. You should meet him.”

// 895
//“I’ll think about it,” Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook his head in
//wonder. “So you really are his one weak point. Huh.”

// 896
//Now Draco was giving Harry a __really__ odd look. “You want to go get
//something to drink and find somewhere to sit down?”

// 897
//Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long, and stretched
//himself, trying to crick his back. “Sure.”

// 898
//The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a quieter area on
//the far side away from the red steam engine. Along the way they passed a stall
//containing a bald, bearded man offering newspapers and comic books and stacked
//neon-green cans.

// 899
//The stallholder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of one of the
//neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the refined and elegant
//Draco Malfoy approaching along with a mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid
//with a scarf tied over his face, causing the stallholder to experience a sudden
//coughing fit in mid-drink and dribble a large amount of neon-green liquid onto
//his beard.

// 900
//“‘Scuse me,” Harry said, “but what __is__ that stuff, exactly?”

// 901
//“Comed-Tea,” said the stallholder. “If you drink it, something surprising is
//bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself or someone else. But it’s
//charmed to vanish just a few seconds later -” Indeed the stain on his beard was
//already disappearing.

// 902
//“How droll,” said Draco. “How very, very droll. Come, Mr. Bronze, let’s go find
//another -”

// 903
//“Hold on,” Harry said.

// 904
//“__Oh come on!__ That’s just, just __juvenile!__”

// 905
//“No, I’m sorry Draco, I __have__ to investigate this. What happens if I
//drink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the conversation completely
//serious?”

// 906
//The stallholder smiled mysteriously. “Who knows? A friend walks by in a frog
//costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen -”

// 907
//“No. I’m sorry. I just don’t believe it. That violates my much-abused
//suspension of disbelief on so many levels I don’t even have the language to
//describe it. There is, there is just __no way__ a bloody __drink__
//can manipulate reality to produce __comedy setups__, or I’m going to give
//up and retire to the Bahamas -”

// 908
//Draco groaned. “Are we __really__ going to do this?”

// 909
//“You don’t have to drink it but I __have__ to investigate. __Have__
//to. How much?”

// 910
//“Five Knuts the can,” the stallholder said.

// 911
//“__Five Knuts?__ You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy drinks for
//__five Knuts the can?”__ Harry reached into his pouch, said “four Sickles,
//four Knuts”, and slapped them down on the counter. “Two dozen cans please.”

// 912
//“I’ll also take one,” Draco sighed, and started to reach for his pockets.

// 913
//Harry shook his head rapidly. “No, I’ve got this, doesn’t count as a favor
//either, I want to see if it works for you too.” He took a can from the stack
//now placed on the counter and tossed it to Draco, then started feeding his
//pouch. The pouch’s Widening Lip ate the cans accompanied by small burping
//noises, which wasn’t exactly helping to restore Harry’s faith that he would
//someday discover a reasonable explanation for all this.

// 914
//Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his hand, Draco was
//looking at him expectantly, and the two of them pulled the ring at the same
//time.

// 915
//Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted their heads back
//and drank the Comed-Tea.

// 916
//It somehow __tasted__ bright green - extra-fizzy and limer than lime.

// 917
//Aside from that, nothing else happened.

// 918
//Harry looked at the stallholder, who was watching them benevolently.

// 919
//__All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural accident to
//sell me twenty-four cans of nothing____, I’m going to applaud his creative
//entrepreneurial spirit and then kill him.__

// 920
//“It doesn’t always happen immediately,” the stallholder said. “But it’s
//guaranteed to happen once per can, or your money back.”

// 921
//Harry took another long drink.

// 922
//Once again, nothing happened.

// 923
//__Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as possible… and hope
//my stomach doesn’t explode from all the carbon dioxide, or that I don’t burp
//while drinking it…__

// 924
//No, he could afford to be a __little__ patient. But honestly, Harry didn’t
//see how this was going to work. You couldn’t go up to someone and say “Now I’m
//going to surprise you” or “And now I’m going to tell you the punchline of the
//joke, and it’ll be really funny.” It ruined the shock value. In Harry’s state
//of mental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in a ballerina
//outfit and it wouldn’t have made him do a proper spit-take. Just what sort of
//wacky shenanigan was the universe supposed to cough up __now?__

// 925
//“Anyway, let’s sit down,” Harry said. He prepared to swig another drink and
//started towards the distant seating area, which put him at the right angle to
//glance back and see the portion of the stall’s newspaper stand that was devoted
//to a newspaper called __The Quibbler__, which was showing the following
//headline:

// 926
//__BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS__

// 927
//__DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT__

// 928
//“__Gah!__” screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed all over him from
//Harry’s direction. Draco turned to Harry with fire in his eyes and grabbed his
//own can. “You son of a mudblood! Let’s see how __you__ like being spat
//upon!” Draco took a deliberate swig from the can just as his own eyes caught
//sight of the headline.

// 929
//In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the spray of liquid
//flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked using the hand containing the
//Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the green liquid to splash out over his
//shoulder.

// 930
//Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking and spluttering
//and the green colour started to vanish from Draco’s robes.

// 931
//Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline.

// 932
//__BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS__

// 933
//__DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT__

// 934
//Harry’s lips opened and said, “buh-bluh-buh-buh…”

// 935
//Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every time Harry tried to
//say “But we’re only eleven!” the objection “But men can’t get pregnant!”
//demanded first priority and was then run over by “But there’s nothing between
//us, really!”

// 936
//Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again.

// 937
//He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the top of his
//lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only thing stopping him was
//that he had once read that outright panic was the sign of a __truly__
//important scientific problem.

// 938
//Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish bin, and stalked
//back over to the stall. “One copy of __The Quibbler,__ please.” Harry paid
//over four more Knuts, retrieved another can of Comed-Tea from his pouch, and
//then stalked over to the picnic area with the blond-haired boy, who was staring
//at his own can with an expression of frank admiration.

// 939
//“I take it back,” Draco said, “that was pretty good.”

// 940
//“Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming friends than
//exchanging secrets? Committing murder.”

// 941
//“I have a tutor who says that,” Draco allowed. He reached inside his robes and
//scratched himself with an easy, natural motion. “Who’ve you got in mind?”

// 942
//Harry slammed __The Quibbler__ down hard on the picnic table. “The guy who
//came up with this headline.”

// 943
//Draco groaned. “Not a guy. A girl. A __ten-year-old__ girl, can you
//believe it? She went nuts after her mother died and her father, who owns this
//newspaper, is __convinced__ that she’s a seer, so when he doesn’t know he
//asks Luna Lovegood and believes __anything __she says.”

// 944
//Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next can of
//Comed-Tea and prepared to drink. “Are you kidding me? That’s even worse than
//Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was physically impossible.”

// 945
//Draco snarled. “She has some sort of perverse obsession about the Malfoys, too,
//and her father is politically opposed to us so he prints every word. As soon as
//I’m old enough I’m going to rape her.”

// 946
//Green liquid spurted out of Harry’s nostrils, soaking into the scarf still
//covering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix, and Harry spent the next
//few seconds frantically coughing.

// 947
//Draco looked at him sharply. “Something wrong?”

// 948
//It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation that (a) the
//sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had turned into more of a
//blurred white noise at around the same time Draco had reached inside his robes,
//and (b) when he had discussed committing murder as a bonding method, there had
//been exactly one person in the conversation who’d thought they were joking.

// 949
//__Right. Because he __seemed__ like such a normal kid. And he
//__is__ a normal kid, he is just what you’d __expect__ a baseline male
//child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.__

// 950
//“Yes, well,” Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out of this
//conversational wedge, “I was just surprised at how you were willing to discuss
//it so openly, you didn’t seem worried about getting caught or anything.”

// 951
//Draco snorted. “Are you joking? __Luna Lovegood’s__ word against mine?”

// 952
//Holy crap on a holy stick. “There’s no such thing as magical truth detection, I
//take it?” __Or DNA testing… yet.__

// 953
//Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. “That’s right, you don’t know anything.
//Look, I’ll explain things to you, I mean the way it really works, just like you
//were already in Slytherin and asked me the same question. But you’ve got to
//swear not to say anything about it.”

// 954
//“I swear,” Harry said.

// 955
//“The courts use Veritaserum, but it’s a joke really, you just get yourself
//Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other person was
//Memory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you’re just some normal person,
//the courts presume in favor of Obliviation, not False Memory Charms. But the
//court has discretion, and if __I’m__ involved then it impinges on the
//honor of a Noble House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the
//votes. After I’m found not guilty the Lovegood family has to pay reparations
//for tarnishing my honor. And they know from the start that’s how it’ll go, so
//they’ll just keep their mouths shut.”

// 956
//A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with instructions to keep
//his voice and face normal. __Note to self: Overthrow government of
//magical Britain at earliest convenience.__

// 957
//Harry coughed again to clear his throat. “Draco, please please __please__
//don’t take this the wrong way, my word is my bond, but like you said I could be
//in Slytherin and I really want to ask for informational purposes, so what would
//happen __theoretically speaking__ if I __did__ testify that I’d heard
//you plan it?”

// 958
//“Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I’d be in trouble,” Draco answered
//smugly. “Since I __am__ a Malfoy… Father has the votes. And afterwards
//he’d crush you… well, I guess not easily, since you __are__ the
//Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is pretty good at that sort of thing.” Draco frowned.
//“‘Sides, __you__ talked about murdering her, why weren’t you worried about
//__me__ testifying after she turns up dead?”

// 959
//__How, oh how did my day go this wrong?__ Harry’s mouth was already moving
//faster than he could think. “That’s when I thought she was__ older!__ I
//don’t know how it works __here__, but in Muggle Britain the courts would
//get a lot more upset about someone killing a child -”

// 960
//“That makes sense,” Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious. “But anyway,
//it’s always smarter if it doesn’t go to the Aurors at all. If we’re careful
//only to do things that Healing Charms can fix, we can just Obliviate her
//afterwards and then do it all again next week.” Then the blonde-haired boy
//giggled, a youthful high-pitched sound. “Though just imagine her saying she’d
//been done by Draco Malfoy __and__ the Boy-Who-Lived, not even
//__Dumbledore__ would believe her.”

// 961
//__I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the
//Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms. “__Actually, can we
//hold off on that? After I found out that headline came from a girl a year
//younger than me, I had a different thought for my revenge.”

// 962
//“Huh? Do tell,” Draco said, and started to take another swig of his Comed-Tea.

// 963
//Harry didn’t know if the enchantment worked more than once per can, but he
//__did__ know he could avoid the blame, so he was careful to time it
//exactly right:

// 964
//“I was thinking __someday I’m going to marry that woman.__”

// 965
//Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid out the corners
//of his mouth like a broken car radiator. “__Are you nuts?__”

// 966
//“Quite the opposite, I’m so sane it burns like ice.”

// 967
//“You’ve got weirder taste than a Lestrange,” Draco said, sounding half-admiring
//about it. “And I suppose you want her all to yourself, huh?”

// 968
//“Yep. I can owe you a favor for it -”

// 969
//Draco waved it off. “Nah, this one’s free.”

// 970
//Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling into his blood.
//Charming, happy, generous with his favors to his friends, Draco wasn’t a
//psychopath. That was the sad and awful part, knowing human psychology well
//enough to __know__ that Draco __wasn’t__ a monster. There had been
//ten thousand societies over the history of the world where this conversation
//could have happened. No, the world would have been a very different place
//indeed, if it took an __evil__ __mutant__ to say what Draco had said.
//It was very simple, very human, it was the default if nothing else intervened.
//To Draco, his enemies weren’t people.

// 971
//And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as in the
//darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a sufficiently
//powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was above the law, at
//least when it came to some peasant girl. There were places in Muggle-land where
//it was still the same way, countries where that sort of nobility still existed
//and still thought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn’t just the
//nobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn’t descend directly
//from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it seemed, which didn’t quite
//include magical Britain, for all that there had been cross-cultural
//contamination of things like ring-pull drinks cans.

// 972
//__And if Draco doesn’t change his mind about wanting revenge, and I don’t
//throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry some poor crazy girl,
//then all I’ve just bought is time, and not too much of it…__

// 973
//For one girl. Not for others.

// 974
//__I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top
//blood purists and kill them.__

// 975
//They’d tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or less - make a
//list of all the enemies of Progress and remove everything above the neck - and
//it hadn’t worked out well from what Harry recalled. Maybe he needed to dust off
//some of those history books his father had bought him, and see if what had gone
//wrong with the French Revolution was something easy to fix.

// 976
//Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon, visible this
//morning through the cloudless air.

// 977
//__So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and bloody and
//dark. This is news? You always knew that, anyway…__

// 978
//“You’re looking all serious,” Draco said. “Let me guess, your Muggle parents
//told you that this sort of thing was bad.”

// 979
//Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice.

// 980
//“Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the end everyone
//belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And frankly, you’re not on the
//Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side with the Malfoys under the table… our
//power and your reputation… you could get away with things even __I__ can’t
//do. Want to __try__ it for a while? See what it’s like?”

// 981
//__Aren’t we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and already coaxing
//your prey from hiding…__

// 982
//Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. “Draco, you want to explain the
//whole blood purity thing to me? I’m sort of new.”

// 983
//A wide smile crossed Draco’s face. “You really should meet Father and ask
//__him__, you know, he’s our leader.”

// 984
//“Give me the thirty-second version.”

// 985
//“Okay,” Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grew slightly
//lower, and took on a cadence. “Our powers have grown weaker, generation by
//generation, as the mudblood taint increases. Where Salazar and Godric and
//Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts by their power, creating the Locket and
//the Sword and the Diadem and the Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen
//to rival them. We are fading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with
//their spawn and allow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked, soon our
//wands will break and all our arts cease, the line of Merlin will end and the
//blood of Atlantis fail. Our children will be left scratching at the dirt to
//survive like the mere Muggles, and darkness will cover all the world for ever.”
//Draco took another swig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed to
//be the whole argument as far as he was concerned.

// 986
//“Persuasive,” Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than normatively. It
//was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the need to guard what purity
//remained against contamination, the past sloping upwards and the future sloping
//only down. And that pattern also had its __counter__… “I have to correct
//you on one point of fact, though. Your information about the Muggles is a bit
//out of date. We aren’t exactly scratching at the dirt anymore.”

// 987
//Draco’s head snapped around. “__What?__ What do you mean, __we?__”

// 988
//“We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of the
//Enlightenment. Muggles didn’t just sit around crying about not having wands, we
//have our __own__ powers now, with or without magic. If all your powers
//fail then we will all have lost something very precious, because your magic is
//the only hint we have as to how the universe must __really__ work - but
//you won’t be left scratching at the ground. Your houses will still be cool in
//summer and warm in winter, there will still be doctors and medicine. Science
//can keep you alive if magic fails. It’d be a tragedy, but not literally the end
//of all the light in the world. Just saying.”

// 989
//Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed fear and
//disbelief. “__What in the name of Merlin are you talking about, Potter?__”

// 990
//“Hey, I listened to __your__ story, won’t you listen to mine?”
//__Clumsy,__ Harry chided himself, but Draco actually did stop backing off
//and seem to listen.

// 991
//“Anyway,” Harry said, “I’m saying that you don’t seem to have been paying much
//attention to what goes on in the Muggle world.” Probably because the whole
//wizarding world seemed to regard the rest of Earth as a slum, deserving around
//as much news coverage as the __Financial Times __awarded to the routine
//agonies of Burundi. “All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever been to the
//Moon? You know, that thing?” Harry pointed up to that huge and distant globe.

// 992
//“__What?__” Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought had never occured
//to the boy. ”__Go__ to the - it’s just a -” His finger pointed at the
//little pale thingy in the sky. “You can’t Apparate to somewhere you’ve never
//__been__ and how would anyone get to the Moon in the __first__
//place?”

// 993
//“Hold on,” Harry said to Draco, “I’d like to show you a book I brought with me,
//I think I remember what box it’s in.” And Harry stood up and kneeled down and
//yanked out the stairs to the cavern level of his trunk, then tore down the
//stairs and heaved a box off another box, coming perilously close to treating
//his books with disrespect, and snatched off the box cover and quickly but
//carefully pried out a stack of books -

// 994
//(Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to remember where all his
//books were, even after seeing them just once, which was rather mysterious
//considering the lack of any genetic connection.)

// 995
//And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back into the trunk
//with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the book until he found the
//picture he wanted to show to Draco.

// 996
//The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited people, and the
//blue-white globe hanging over it all.

// 997
//That picture.

// 998
//__The__ picture, if only one picture in all the world were to survive.

// 999
//“__That__,” Harry said, his voice trembling because he couldn’t quite keep
//the pride out, “is what the Earth looks like from the Moon.”

// 1000
//Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on his young face. “If
//that’s a __real__ picture, why isn’t it moving?”

// 1001
//__Moving?__ Oh. “Muggles can do moving pictures but they need a bigger box
//to show it, they can’t fit them onto single book pages yet.”

// 1002
//Draco’s finger moved to one of the suits. “What are those?” His voice starting
//to waver.

// 1003
//“Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover their whole bodies
//to give them air, because there is no air on the Moon.”

// 1004
//“That’s impossible,” Draco whispered. There was terror in his eyes, and utter
//confusion. “No Muggle could ever do that. __How…__”

// 1005
//Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what he saw. “This
//is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and higher, until it gets to
//the Moon.” Flipped pages again. “This is a rocket on the ground. That tiny
//speck next to it is a person.” Draco gasped. “Going to the Moon cost the
//equivalent of… probably around a thousand million Galleons.” Draco choked. “And
//it took the efforts of… probably more people than live in all of magical
//Britain.” __And when they arrived, they left a plaque that said, ‘We came
//in peace, for all mankind.’ Though you’re not yet ready to hear those words,
//Draco Malfoy…__

// 1006
//“You’re telling the truth,” Draco said slowly. “You wouldn’t fake a whole book
//just for this - and I can hear it in your voice. But… but…”

// 1007
//“How, without wands or magic? It’s a long story, Draco. Science doesn’t work by
//waving wands and chanting spells, it works by knowing how the universe works on
//such a deep level that you know exactly what to do in order to make the
//universe do what you want. If magic is like casting __Imperio__ on someone
//to make them do what you want, then science is like knowing them so well that
//you can convince them it was their own idea all along. It’s a lot more
//difficult than waving a wand, but it works when wands fail, just like if the
//__Imperius__ failed you could still try persuading a person. And Science
//builds from generation to generation. You have to really __know__ what
//you’re doing to do science - and when you really understand something, you can
//explain it to someone else. The greatest scientists of one century ago, the
//brightest names that are still spoken with reverence, their powers are as
//__nothing__ to the greatest scientists of today. There is no equivalent in
//science of your lost arts that raised Hogwarts. In science our powers wax by
//the year. And we are beginning to understand and unravel the secrets of life
//and inheritance. We’ll be able to look at the very blood of which you spoke,
//and see what makes you a wizard, and in one or two more generations, we’ll be
//able to persuade that blood to make all your children powerful wizards too. So
//you see, your problem isn’t nearly as bad as it looks, because in a few more
//decades, science will be able to solve it for you.”

// 1008
//“But…” Draco said. His voice was trembling. “If __Muggles__ have that kind
//of power… then… what are __we?__”

// 1009
//“No, Draco, that’s not it, don’t you see? Science taps the power of human
//understanding to look at the world and figure out how it works. It can’t fail
//without humanity itself failing. Your magic could turn off, and you would hate
//that, but you would still be __you__. You would still be alive to regret
//it. But because science rests upon my human intelligence, it is the power that
//cannot be removed from me without removing __me.__ Even if the laws of the
//universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is void, I’ll just figure out
//the new laws, as has been done before. It’s not a __Muggle__ thing, it’s a
//__human__ thing, it just refines and trains the power you use every time
//you look at something you don’t understand and ask ‘Why?’ You’re of Slytherin,
//Draco, don’t you see the implication?”

// 1010
//Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawning understanding.
//“Wizards can learn to use this power.”

// 1011
//Very carefully, now… the bait is set, now the hook… “If you can learn to think
//of yourself as a __human__ instead of a __wizard__ then you can train
//and refine your powers as a human.”

// 1012
//And if __that__ instruction wasn’t in __every__ science curriculum,
//Draco didn’t need to know it, did he?

// 1013
//Draco’s eyes were now thoughtful. “You’ve… already done this?”

// 1014
//“To some extent,” Harry allowed. “My training isn’t complete. Not at eleven.
//But - my father __also__ bought me tutors, you see.” Sure, they’d been
//starving grad students, and it had only been because Harry slept on a 26-hour
//cycle, but leave all that aside for now…

// 1015
//Slowly, Draco nodded. “You think you can master __both__ arts, add the
//powers together, and…” Draco stared at Harry. “Make yourself Lord of the two
//worlds?”

// 1016
//Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at that point. “You
//have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you know, all of magical Britain,
//is just one square on a much larger gameboard. The gameboard that includes
//places like the Moon, and the stars in the night sky, which are lights just
//like the Sun only unimaginably far away, and things like galaxies that are
//vastly huger than the Earth and Sun, things so large that only scientists can
//see them and you don’t even know they exist. But I really __am__
//Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don’t want to rule the universe. I just
//think it could be more sensibly organised.”

// 1017
//There was awe on Draco’s face. “Why are you telling __me__ this?”

// 1018
//“Oh… there aren’t many people who know how to do __true__ science -
//understanding something for the very first time, even if it confuses the hell
//out of you. Help would be helpful.”

// 1019
//Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open.

// 1020
//“But make no mistake, Draco, true science really __isn’t__ like magic, you
//can’t just do it and walk away unchanged like learning how to say the words of
//a new spell. The power comes with a cost, a cost so high that most people
//refuse to pay it.”

// 1021
//Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he’d heard something he could
//understand. “And that cost?”

// 1022
//“Learning to admit you’re wrong.”

// 1023
//“Um,” Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for a while. “You
//going to explain that?”

// 1024
//“Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level, the first
//ninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The hundredth is right. So
//you have to learn how to admit you’re wrong, over and over and over again. It
//doesn’t sound like much, but it’s so hard that most people can’t do science.
//Always questioning yourself, always taking another look at things you’ve always
//taken for granted,” like having a Snitch in Quidditch, “and every time you
//change your mind, you change yourself. But I’m getting way ahead of myself
//here. Way ahead of myself. I just want you to know… I’m offering to share some
//of my knowledge. If you want. There’s just one condition.”

// 1025
//“Uh huh,” Draco said. “You know, Father says that when someone says that to
//you, it is never a good sign, ever.”

// 1026
//Harry nodded. “Now, don’t mistake me and think that I’m trying to drive a wedge
//between you and your father. It’s not about that. It’s just about me wanting to
//deal with someone my own age, rather than having this be between me and Lucius.
//I think your father would be okay with that too, he knows you have to grow up
//sometime. But your moves in our game have to be your own. That’s my condition -
//that I’m dealing with you, Draco, not your father.”

// 1027
//“I’ve got to go,” Draco said. He stood up. “I’ve got to go off and think about
//this.”

// 1028
//“Take your time,” Harry said.

// 1029
//The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmurs as Draco
//wandered off.

// 1030
//Harry slowly exhaled the air he’d been holding in without quite realising it,
//and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple mechanical model that his
//father had bought him in hope it would work in magic’s presence. The
//second-hand was still ticking, and if the minute hand was right, then it wasn’t
//quite eleven just yet. He probably ought to get on the train soon and start
//looking for whatsherface, but it seemed worth taking a few minutes first to do
//some breathing exercises and see if his blood warmed up again.

// 1031
//But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures approaching,
//looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by winter scarves.

// 1032
//“Hello, Mr. Bronze,” said one of the masked figures. “Can we interest you in
//joining the Order of Chaos?”

'''

// 1033
//__Aftermath:__

// 1034
//Not too long after that, when all that day’s fuss had finally subsided, Draco
//was bent over a desk with quill in hand. He had a private room in the Slytherin
//dungeons, with its own desk and its own fire - sadly not even __he__ rated
//a connection to the Floo system, but at least Slytherin didn’t buy into that
//utter nonsense about making __everyone__ sleep in dorms. There weren’t
//many private rooms, you had to be the __very__ best within the House of
//the better sort, but that could be taken for granted with the House of Malfoy.

// 1035
//__Dear Father,__ Draco wrote.

// 1036
//And then he stopped.

// 1037
//Ink slowly dripped from his quill, staining the parchment near the words.

// 1038
//Draco wasn’t stupid. He was young, but his tutors had trained him well. Draco
//knew that Potter probably felt a lot more sympathy towards Dumbledore’s faction
//than Potter was letting on… though Draco did think Potter could be tempted. But
//it was crystal clear that Potter was trying to tempt Draco just as Draco was
//trying to tempt him.

// 1039
//And it was also clear that Potter was brilliant, and a whole lot more than just
//slightly mad, and playing a vast game that Potter himself mostly didn’t
//understand, improvised at top speed with the subtlety of a rampaging nundu. But
//Potter had managed to choose a tactic that Draco couldn’t just walk away from.
//He had offered Draco a part of his own power, gambling that Draco couldn’t use
//it without becoming more like him. His father had called this an advanced
//technique, and had warned Draco that it often didn’t work.

// 1040
//Draco knew he hadn’t understood everything that had happened… but Potter had
//offered __him__ the chance to play and right now it was __his.__ And
//if he blurted the whole thing out, it would become Father’s.

// 1041
//In the end it was as simple as that. The lesser techniques require the
//unawareness of the target, or at least their uncertainty. Flattery has to be
//plausibly disguised as admiration. (“You should have been in Slytherin” is an
//old classic, highly effective on a certain type of person who isn’t expecting
//it, and if it works you can repeat it.) But when you find someone’s ultimate
//lever it doesn’t matter if they know you know. Potter, in his mad rush, had
//guessed a key to Draco’s soul. And if Draco knew that Potter knew it - even if
//it had been an obvious sort of guess - that didn’t change anything.

// 1042
//So now, for the first time in his life, he had real secrets to keep. He was
//playing his own game. There was an obscure pain to it, but he knew that Father
//would be proud, and that made it all right.

// 1043
//Leaving the ink drippings in place - there was a message there, and one that
//his father would understand, for they had played the game of subtleties more
//than once - Draco wrote out the one question that really had gnawed at him
//about the whole affair, the part that it seemed he __ought__ to
//understand, but he didn’t, not at all.

// 1044
//__Dear Father:__

// 1045
//__Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not already part
//of our circle of acquaintances, who called you a ‘flawless instrument of death’
//and said that I was your ‘one weak point’. What would you say about him?__

// 1046
//It didn’t take long after that for the family owl to bring the reply.

// 1047
//__My beloved son:__

// 1048
//__I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet someone who
//enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and valuable ally, Severus Snape.__

// 1049
//Draco stared at the letter for a while, and finally threw it into the fire.
