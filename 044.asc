//== Humanism, Pt 2

// 8169
//“Fawkes,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, “help him, please -”

// 8170
//A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of vision, looking
//down quizzically; and it began to croon.

// 8171
//The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing onto which
//they could hold.

// 8172
//“You’re noisy,” said the voice, “you should die.”

// 8173
//“Chocolate,” Albus Dumbledore said, “you need chocolate, and your friends - but
//I dare not take you back -”

// 8174
//Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick’s voice; whereupon
//Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, and cursed aloud at his own
//stupidity.

// 8175
//The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to be amused.

// 8176
//And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire.

// 8177
//It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick’s raven had flown to
//elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in another crack of red and
//golden fire with Harry in his arms; but somehow in that time Hermione had
//already managed to fill her hands with chocolate.

// 8178
//Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the table and straight
//into Harry’s mouth, which a tiny part of her mind said was unfair,
//__he’d__ gotten a chance to do it for __her -__

// 8179
//Harry spat the chocolate back out again.

// 8180
//“Go away,” said a voice so empty it wasn’t even cold.

// 8181
//…

// 8182
//Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward Harry halted,
//all movements broken by the shock of those two dead words.

// 8183
//Then: “No,” said Albus Dumbledore, “I will not,” and time resumed again, even
//as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the table and into Harry’s mouth.

// 8184
//Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry’s expression become more
//hateful, as his mouth chewed with a mechanical, unnatural rhythm.

// 8185
//The Headmaster’s voice was grim as iron. “Filius, call Minerva, tell her she
//must come at speed.”

// 8186
//Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew into the air and
//vanished.

// 8187
//Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry’s mouth, and the mechanical
//chewing continued.

// 8188
//There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster watched over
//Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender, Ernie, Terry, Anthony,
//none of them daring to approach any closer than Hermione had.

// 8189
//“What can we do?” said Dean in a trembling voice.

// 8190
//“Back off and give him more space -” said the dry voice of Professor Quirrell.

// 8191
//“No!” interrupted the Headmaster. “Let him be surrounded by his friends.”

// 8192
//Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice, “They’re stupid.
//They should die__mmmppphhh__” as another piece of chocolate entered his
//mouth.

// 8193
//Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.

// 8194
//“He doesn’t mean it, does he?” Seamus said it like he was begging.

// 8195
//“You don’t understand,” Hermione said, her voice breaking, “__that’s not
//Harry -__” and she shut up before she said anything more, but she __had__
//to say that much.

// 8196
//She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and she also saw
//that the others didn’t. If Harry had really never thought anything like that,
//then being exposed to a Dementor for less than a minute wouldn’t have made him
//say it. That’s what they were probably thinking.

// 8197
//Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn’t create a whole new evil person
//inside you out of nothing.

// 8198
//But if that person was __already there__ -

// 8199
//__Does the Headmaster know?__

// 8200
//Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus Dumbledore was
//gazing at __her__, and that his blue eyes had grown suddenly piercing -

// 8201
//Words came into her mind.

// 8202
//__Do not speak of it,__ said the will of Dumbledore to her.

// 8203
//__You know,__ thought Hermione. __About his dark side.__

// 8204
//__I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes’s song cannot reach him,
//where he is lost.__

// 8205
//__What can we -__

// 8206
//__I have a plan,__ sent the Headmaster. __Patience.__

// 8207
//Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous. __What
//sort of plan?__

// 8208
//__It is better that you not know,__ sent the Headmaster.

// 8209
//Now Hermione was getting __really__ nervous. She didn’t know how
//__much__ the Headmaster knew about Harry’s dark side -

// 8210
//__A fair point,__ sent the Headmaster. __I am about to tell you;
//steel yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I am going to pretend
//to cast the Killing Curse on Professor McGonagall - DO NOT REACT, Hermione!__

// 8211
//That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn’t bring Harry
//__out__ of his dark side, Harry would go __completely berserk__, he’d
//__kill__ the Headmaster -

// 8212
//__But that is not true darkness,__ sent Albus Dumbledore. __That is
//protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to reach him, then. And when
//Harry sees that Minerva is alive after all, it will return him fully.__

// 8213
//The thought came to Hermione -

// 8214
//__I doubt that will work,__ sent the Headmaster, __and you may not
//like the way he reacts if you try. But you may try if you wish.__

// 8215
//She hadn’t really meant that seriously! It was too -

// 8216
//Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to the boy
//looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept chewing and
//swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect. Her heart wrenched, and
//suddenly a lot of things didn’t seem to matter, only that there was a chance.

// 8217
//There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The response to
//compulsion was killing.

// 8218
//People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The response to
//annoyance was killing.

// 8219
//Other people were chattering in the background. That was insolent. The response
//to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them were useful, killing
//them would be simpler.

// 8220
//Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them didn’t trust
//Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right trigger could cause them
//all to kill each other.

// 8221
//Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did something completely
//strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode of thought, for which there
//was only a single response stored anywhere -

// 8222
//She heard the gasps around her, and they didn’t matter, she maintained the kiss
//on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears welled in her eyes.

// 8223
//And Harry’s arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips yelled, “__I
//told you, no kissing!__”

// 8224
//“I think he’ll be all right now,” the Headmaster said, looking at where Harry
//was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned over him. “Excellently
//done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I would have expected that to
//actually work?”

// 8225
//The phoenix’s song wasn’t meant for her, Hermione knew, but she could still be
//soothed by it, which she needed, because her life was officially over.
