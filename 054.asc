// 9409
//== The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 4

// 9410
//A faint green spark moved forward to set the pace, and behind it followed a
//brilliant silver figure, all other entities invisible. They had traversed five
//legs of corridor, turned right five times and gone up five flights of stairs;
//and when Bellatrix had finished her second bottle of chocolate milk, she had
//been given solid bars of chocolate to eat.

// 9411
//It was after her third bar of chocolate that strange noises began to come from
//Bellatrix’s throat.

// 9412
//It took a moment for Harry to understand, to process the sounds, it didn’t
//sound like anything he’d ever heard before; the rhythm of it was shattered,
//almost unrecognizable, it took him that long to realize that Bellatrix was
//crying.

// 9413
//Bellatrix Black was crying, the Dark Lord’s most terrible weapon was crying,
//she was invisible but you could hear it, tiny pathetic sounds she was trying to
//suppress, even now.

// 9414
//“It’s real?” said Bellatrix. Tonality had returned into her voice, no longer a
//dead mutter, it rose up at the end to form the question. “It’s real?”

// 9415
//__Yes,__ thought the part of Harry simulating the Dark Lord, __now
//be silent __-

// 9416
//He couldn’t make those words pass his lips, he just couldn’t.

// 9417
//“I knew - you would - come to me - someday,” Bellatrix’s voice quavered and
//fractured as she drew breath for quiet sobs, “I knew - you were alive - that
//you would come - to me - my Lord…” there was a long inhalation like a huge
//gasp, “and that even - when you came - you still wouldn’t love me - never - you
//would never love me back - that was why - they couldn’t take - my love from me
//- even though I can’t remember - can’t remember so many other things - though I
//don’t know what I forgot - but I remember how much I love you, Lord -”

// 9418
//There was a knife stabbing through Harry’s heart, he’d never heard anything so
//terrible, he wanted to hunt down the Dark Lord and kill him just for this…

// 9419
//“Do you still - have use for me - my Lord?”

// 9420
//“No,” hissed Harry’s voice, without him even thinking, it just seemed to be
//operating on automatic, “I entered Azkaban on a whim. Of course I have use for
//you! Don’t ask foolish questions.”

// 9421
//“But - I’m weak,” said Bellatrix’s voice, and a full sob escaped her, it
//sounded much too loud in the corridors of Azkaban, “I can’t kill for you, my
//Lord, I’m sorry, they ate it all, ate me all up, I’m too weak to fight, what
//good am I to you now -”

// 9422
//Harry’s brain cast about desperately for some way to reassure her, from the
//lips of a Dark Lord who would never speak a single word of caring.

// 9423
//“Ugly,” said Bellatrix. Her voice said that word like it was the final nail in
//her coffin, the last despair. “I’m ugly, they ate that too, I’m, I’m not pretty
//any more, you won’t even, be able, to use me, as a reward, for your servants -
//even the Lestranges, won’t want, to hurt me, any more -”

// 9424
//The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.

// 9425
//Because Harry had stopped walking.

// 9426
//__The Dark Lord, he…__ The part of Harry’s self that was soft and
//vulnerable was screaming in disbelieving horror, trying to reject reality,
//refuse the understanding, even as a colder and harder part completed the
//pattern: __She obeyed him in that as she obeyed him in all things.__

// 9427
//The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.

// 9428
//The silver humanoid stayed in place.

// 9429
//Bellatrix was sobbing harder.

// 9430
//“I’m, I’m not, I can’t be, useful, any more…”

// 9431
//Giant hands were squeezing Harry’s chest, wringing him like a washcloth, trying
//to crush his heart.

// 9432
//“Please,” whispered Bellatrix, “just kill me…” Her voice seemed to calm, once
//she said that. “Please Lord, kill me, I’ve no reason to live if I’m no use to
//you… I only want it to stop… please hurt me one last time, my Lord, hurt me
//until I stop… I love you…”

// 9433
//It was the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.

// 9434
//The bright silver shape of Harry’s Patronus flickered -

// 9435
//Wavered -

// 9436
//Brightened -

// 9437
//The fury that was rising in Harry, his rage against the Dark Lord who had done
//this, the rage against the Dementors, against Azkaban, against the world that
//allowed such horror, it all seemed to be pouring straight through his arm and
//into his wand without there being any way of blocking it, he tried willing it
//to stop and nothing happened.

// 9438
//“My Lord!” whispered the disguised voice of Professor Quirrell. “My spell is
//going out of control! Help me, my Lord!”

// 9439
//Brighter the Patronus, brighter and brighter, it was waxing faster than on the
//day that Harry had destroyed a Dementor.

// 9440
//“My Lord!” the silhouette said in a terrified whisper. “Help me! Everyone will
//feel it, my Lord!”

// 9441
//__Everyone will feel it,__ thought Harry. His imagination could picture it
//clearly, the prisoners in their cells stirring as the cold and darkness fell
//away, replaced by healing light.

// 9442
//Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the reflections, the
//silhouette of Bellatrix’s skeleton and the sallow man now clearly visible in
//the blaze, the Disillusionment spells unable to keep pace with the unearthly
//brilliance; only the Cloak of Invisibility out of the Deathly Hallows withstood
//it.

// 9443
//“My Lord! __You must stop it!__”

// 9444
//But Harry could no longer will it to stop, he no longer wanted it to stop. He
//could sense it, more and more of the sparks of life in Azkaban being sheltered
//by his Patronus, __as it unfolded like spreading wings of sunlight, the
//air turned to absolute silver as he thought it, Harry knew what he had to do.__

// 9445
//“__Please, my Lord!__”

// 9446
//The words went unheard.

// 9447
//__They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but Harry knew that
//they could be destroyed even at this distance if the light blazed bright
//enough, he knew that Death itself could not face him if he stopped holding
//back, so he unsealed all the gates inside him and sank the wells of his spell
//into all the deepest parts of his spirit, all his mind and all his will, and
//gave over absolutely everything to the spell -__

// 9448
//And in the interior of the Sun, an only slightly dimmer shadow moved forward,
//reaching out an entreating hand.

// 9449
//__WRONG__

// 9450
//__DON’T__

// 9451
//The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry’s steel determination, dread and
//uncertainty striving against the bright purpose, nothing else might have
//reached him but that. The silhouette took another step forward and another, the
//sense of doom rising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of
//cold water, Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he was doing,
//the danger and the trap.

// 9452
//If you had been watching from outside you would have seen the interior of the
//Sun brightening and dimming…

// 9453
//Brightening and dimming…

// 9454
//…and finally fading, fading, fading into ordinary moonlight that seemed like
//pitch darkness by contrast.

// 9455
//Within the darkness of that moonlight stood a sallow man with his hand
//outstretched in entreaty, and the skeleton of a woman, lying upon the floor, a
//puzzled look upon her face.

// 9456
//And Harry, still invisible, fallen to his knees. The greater danger had passed,
//and now Harry was just trying not to collapse, to keep the spell going at the
//lower level. He’d drained something, hopefully not lost something __-__ he
//should have known, should have remembered, that it wasn’t mere magic that
//fueled the Patronus Charm -

// 9457
//“Thank you, my Lord,” whispered the sallow man.

// 9458
//“Fool,” said the hard voice of a boy pretending to be a Dark Lord. “Did I not
//warn you that the spell could prove fatal if you failed to control your
//emotions?”

// 9459
//Professor Quirrell’s eyes did not widen, of course.

// 9460
//“Yes, my Lord, I understand,” said the Dark Lord’s servant in a faltering
//voice, and turned to Bellatrix -

// 9461
//She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an old, old Muggle
//woman. “How funny,” Bellatrix whispered, “you were almost killed by a Patronus
//Charm…” A giggle that sounded like it was blowing dust out of her giggle pipes.
//“I could punish you, maybe, if my Lord froze you in place and I had knives…
//maybe I can be useful after all? Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange…”

// 9462
//“Be silent, dear Bella,” Harry said in a chill voice, “until I give you leave
//to speak.”

// 9463
//There was no reply, which was obedience.

// 9464
//The servant levitated the human skeleton, and made her invisible once more,
//followed shortly by his own disappearance with the sound of another cracking
//egg.

// 9465
//They passed on through the corridors of Azkaban.

// 9466
//And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring in their cells
//as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe even feeling a small touch of
//healing as his light passed them by, and then collapsing down again as the cold
//and darkness pressed back in.

// 9467
//Harry was trying very hard not to think about it.

// 9468
//Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in
//Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at this distance…

// 9469
//Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in
//Azkaban, taking all of Harry’s life as fuel.

// 9470
//In the Auror’s quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio was snoring in
//the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the breakroom, and one Auror trio
//was on duty in the command room, keeping their watch. The command room was
//simple but large, with three chairs at back where three Aurors sat, their wands
//always in hand to sustain their three Patronuses, as the bright white forms
//paced in front of the open window, sheltering them all from the Dementors’
//fear.

// 9471
//The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker, and didn’t look
//out the window. You could have seen some sky there, sure, and there was even an
//hour or two every day where you could’ve seen some sun, but that window also
//looked down on the central pit of hell.

// 9472
//Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.

// 9473
//There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty here, triple pay
//or no triple pay, if he hadn’t had a family to support. (His real name was
//Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike instead; he’d named his children Su and
//Kao, which hopefully would serve them better.) His only consolation, besides
//the money, was that at least his mates played an excellent game of Dragon
//Poker. Though it would be hard __not__ to, at this point.

// 9474
//It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his best hand of
//the 5300s. It was a Saturday in February and there were three players, which
//let him shift the suit of any one hole card except a two, three, or seven; and
//that was enough to let him build a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons, and
//sevens…

// 9475
//Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the table cards
//toward the direction of the window, staring.

// 9476
//The sinking feeling came over Li’s stomach with surprising speed.

// 9477
//If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned into a six, he
//was going straight down to two pair and McCusker might beat that -

// 9478
//“Mike,” said McCusker, “what’s with your Patronus?”

// 9479
//Li turned his head and looked.

// 9480
//His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the pit and was
//staring downward at something only it could see.

// 9481
//A moment later, Bahry’s moonlit duck and McCusker’s bright anteater followed
//suit, staring in the same downward direction.

// 9482
//They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.

// 9483
//“I’ll tell them,” said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the three Aurors who
//were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate anything anomalous. “Maybe
//relieve one of them and take the C spiral, if you two don’t mind.”

// 9484
//Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. It wasn’t too hard
//to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough to hire a powerful wizard,
//and well-intentioned enough to recruit someone who could cast the Patronus
//Charm. People with friends in Azkaban would do that, break in just to give
//someone a half-day’s worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams
//instead of nightmares. Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their
//cell, to increase the chance they lived through their sentence. And the Aurors
//on guard… well, even if you got caught, you could probably convince the Aurors
//to overlook it, in exchange for the right bribe.

// 9485
//For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts and a silver
//Sickle. He hated this place.

// 9486
//But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer’s bills, and if you could
//afford to hire someone who could break into Azkaban, then you could afford to
//grease Bahry’s remaining palm pretty hard, if he was the one who caught you.

// 9487
//By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by being the first to
//propose it, the three of them finished out their poker hand first. Li won,
//since no Dementors had actually shown up. And by then the Patronuses had
//stopped staring and gone back to their normal patrol, so it was probably
//nothing, but procedure was procedure.

// 9488
//After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and stood up from
//the table. The older man’s long white locks brushed against his fancy red
//robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of the command room, as Bahry went
//through the separating door that led to the formerly off-duty Aurors.

// 9489
//Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a little queasy about
//this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them all the pictures, and you had
//to let a man do what he could for his poor sick wife, especially when he only
//had seven months left before his retirement.

// 9490
//The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and the silver
//humanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after it. Sometimes the bright
//figure would flare, especially when they passed one of the huge metal doors,
//but it always died back down again.

// 9491
//Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the eleven-year-old
//Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was Bellatrix Black, and the
//Polyjuiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts, all traveling together through
//Azkaban. If that was the beginning of a joke, Harry didn’t know the punchline.

// 9492
//They’d gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough voice of the
//Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis, “Auror coming.”

// 9493
//It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand, for the jolt
//of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to remember what Professor
//Quirrell had already discussed with him and told him to do in this case, and
//then Harry spun on his heel and flew back the way they’d come.

// 9494
//Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself down on the
//third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard even through his cloak and
//robes. Trying to move his head up, to peer over the lip of the stairs, showed
//that he couldn’t see Professor Quirrell; and that meant that Harry was out of
//the line of any stray fire.

// 9495
//His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him on the step
//just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.

// 9496
//There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the sound of
//Bellatrix’s invisible body coming to rest on a stair further below, she had no
//place in this except -

// 9497
//“Stay still,” said the cold high whisper, “stay silent.”

// 9498
//There was stillness, and silence.

// 9499
//Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just above him. If he
//was anyone else he would have needed to take a Knut out of his pocket… or rip
//off a bit of cloth from his robe… or bite off one of his nails… or find a speck
//of rock large enough that he could see it and solid enough to stay in one place
//and orientation while it touched his wand. But with Harry’s almighty power of
//partial Transfiguration, this was not necessary; he could skip that particular
//step of the operation and use any material near to hand.

// 9500
//Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and…

// 9501
//“__Wingardium Leviosa,__” Harry whispered as quietly as he could.

// 9502
//…was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that curved surface,
//almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell invisibly waited.

// 9503
//Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of footsteps.

// 9504
//And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a person in red robes,
//coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly empty corridor; accompanied by a
//small Patronus animal that Harry couldn’t quite make out.

// 9505
//The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see the details but
//Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields already raised and
//strengthened.

// 9506
//__Crap,__ thought Harry. According to the Defense Professor, the essential
//art of dueling consisted of trying to put up defenses that would block whatever
//someone was likely to throw at you, while trying in turn to attack in ways that
//were likely to go past their current set of defenses. And by far the easiest
//way to win any sort of real fight - Professor Quirrell had said this over and
//over - was to shoot the enemy before they raised a shield in the first place,
//either from behind or from close enough range that they couldn’t dodge or
//counter in time.

// 9507
//Though Professor Quirrell might still be able to get in a shot from behind, if
//-

// 9508
//But the Auror halted after taking three steps into the corridor.

// 9509
//“Nice Disillusionment,” said a hard male voice that Harry didn’t recognize.
//“Now show yourself, or you’ll be in __real__ trouble.”

// 9510
//The form of the sallow, bearded man became visible then.

// 9511
//“And you with the Patronus,” said the hard voice. “Come out too. __Now.__”

// 9512
//“Wouldn’t be smart,” said the gravelly voice of the sallow man. It was no
//longer the terrified voice of the Dark Lord’s servant; it had suddenly become
//the professional intimidation of a competent criminal. “You don’t want to see
//who’s behind me. Trust me, you don’t. Five hundred Galleons, cold cash up
//front, if you turn around and walk away. Big trouble for your career if you
//don’t.”

// 9513
//There was a long pause.

// 9514
//“Look, whoever you are,” said the hard voice. “You seem confused about how this
//works. I don’t care if that’s Lucius Malfoy behind you or Albus bloody
//Dumbledore. You __all__ come out, I scan the whole lot of you, and
//__then__ we talk about how much this is going to cost you -”

// 9515
//“Two thousand Galleons, final offer,” said the gravelly voice, taking on a
//warning undertone. “That’s ten times the going rate and more than you make in a
//year. And believe me, if you see something you shouldn’t, you’re going to
//regret not taking that -”

// 9516
//“Shut it!” said the hard voice. “You’ve got exactly five seconds to drop that
//wand before I drop you. Five, four -”

// 9517
//__What are you doing, Professor Quirrell?__ Harry thought frantically.
//__Attack first! Cast a shield at least!__

// 9518
//“- three, two, one! __Stupefy!__”

// 9519
//Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine.

// 9520
//The man’s wand had moved so fast that it was like it had Apparated into place,
//and Bahry’s stunner was currently sparkling tamely at the end of it, not
//blocked, not countered, not deflected, __caught__ like a fly in honey.

// 9521
//“My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons,” said the man in a
//colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile looked wrong on that
//bearded face. “And you shall need to accept a Memory Charm.”

// 9522
//Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that his own stunner
//couldn’t pass back through, already tilted his wand back into a defensive
//position, already raised his hardened artificial hand into position to block
//anything blockable, and was already thinking wordless spells to put more layers
//on his shields -

// 9523
//The man wasn’t looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously at Bahry’s
//stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand, drawing out red sparks
//and flicking them away with his fingers, slowly disassembling the hex like a
//child’s rod puzzle.

// 9524
//The man hadn’t raised any shields of his own.

// 9525
//“Tell me,” the man said in a disinterested voice that didn’t seem to quite fit
//the rough throat - Polyjuice, Bahry would have called it, if he’d thought that
//anyone could possibly do magic that delicate from inside someone else’s body -
//“what did you do in the last war? Put yourself in harm’s way, or stay out of
//trouble?”

// 9526
//“Harm’s way,” said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an Auror with nearly
//a hundred full years on the force, seven months short of mandatory retirement,
//Mad-Eye Moody couldn’t have said it with any more hardness.

// 9527
//“Fight any Death Eaters?”

// 9528
//Now a grim smile graced Bahry’s own face. “Two at once.” Two of You-Know-Who’s
//own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their dark master. Two Death
//Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had been the toughest fight of Bahry’s
//life, but he’d stood his ground, and walked away with only the loss of his left
//hand.

// 9529
//“Did you kill them?” The man sounded idly curious, and he continued to draw
//threads of fire out of the much-diminished stunbolt still captive on the end of
//his wand, his fingers now weaving small patterns of Bahry’s own magic before
//flicking to disperse them.

// 9530
//Sweat broke out on Bahry’s skin beneath his robes. His metal hand flashed
//downward, ripped the mirror from his belt - “Bahry to Mike, I need backup!”

// 9531
//There was a pause, and silence.

// 9532
//“Bahry to Mike!”

// 9533
//The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put it back on his
//belt.

// 9534
//“It’s been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a serious opponent,”
//the man said, still not looking up at Bahry. “Try not to disappoint me too
//much. You can attack whenever you’re ready. Or you can walk away with five
//hundred Galleons.”

// 9535
//There was a long silence.

// 9536
//Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed his wand
//downward.

// 9537
//Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid the lights and
//flashes, his mirror’s curve was perfect (they’d practiced that tactic before in
//the Chaos Legion) but the scene was still too small, and Harry had the feeling
//he wouldn’t be able to understand even if he was watching from a meter away, it
//was all happening too __fast,__ red blasts deflecting from blue shields,
//green bars of light clashing together, shadowy forms appearing and vanishing,
//he couldn’t even tell who was casting what, except that the Auror was shouting
//incantation after incantation and frantically dodging while Professor
//Quirrell’s Polyjuiced form stood in one place and flicked his wand, mostly
//silently, but now and then pronouncing words in unrecognizable languages that
//would white out the whole mirror and show half the Auror’s shielding torn away
//as he staggered back.

// 9538
//Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest seventh-year students,
//and this was so far above it that Harry’s mind felt numbed, looking at how far
//he had left to go. There wasn’t a single seventh-year student who could have
//lasted half a minute against the Auror, all three seventh-year armies put
//together might not be able to scratch the Defense Professor…

// 9539
//The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand supporting himself as
//the other hand gestured frantically and his mouth shouted desperate words, the
//few incantations that Harry recognized were all shield spells, as a flock of
//shadows spun around the Auror like a whirlwind of razors.

// 9540
//And Harry saw Professor Quirrell’s Polyjuiced form deliberately point his wand
//at where the Auror kneeled and fought the last moments of his battle.

// 9541
//“Surrender,” said the gravelly voice.

// 9542
//The Auror spat something unspeakable.

// 9543
//“In that case,” said the voice, “__Avada __-”

// 9544
//Time seemed to move very slowly, like there was time to hear the individual
//syllables, __Ke,__ and __Da,__ and __Vra,__ time to watch the
//Auror starting to throw himself desperately aside; and even though it was all
//happening so slowly, somehow there wasn’t time to __do__ anything, no time
//for Harry to open his lips and scream __NO__, no time to move, maybe even
//not any time to think.

// 9545
//Only time for one desperate wish that an innocent man should not die__ -__

// 9546
//And a blazing silver figure stood before the Auror.

// 9547
//Stood there just a fraction of a second before the green light struck home.

// 9548
//Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was going to make it -

// 9549
//His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death, so Bahry only
//briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette, the Patronus brighter than
//any he’d ever seen, saw it just barely long enough to recognize the impossible
//shape, before the green and the silver light collided and both lights vanished,
//__both __lights vanished, __the Killing Curse had been blocked__, and
//then Bahry’s ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent screaming,
//screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and screaming, starting to fall as
//Bahry was already falling -

// 9550
//Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and his dislocated
//left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest. Bahry ignored the pain,
//managed to scramble back to his knees, brought up his wand to stun his
//opponent, he didn’t understand what was happening but he knew that this was his
//only chance.

// 9551
//“__Stupefy!__”

// 9552
//The red bolt struck out toward the man’s falling body, and was torn apart in
//midair and dissipated - and not by any shield. Bahry could __see__ it, the
//wavering in the air that surrounded his fallen and screaming opponent.

// 9553
//Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux of magic
//building and building and building toward some terrible breaking point. His
//instincts screamed at him to run before the explosion came, this was no Charm,
//no Curse, this was wizardry run wild, but before Bahry could even finish
//getting to his feet -

// 9554
//The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away his wand!) and a second
//later, his form blurred and vanished entirely.

// 9555
//A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even before Bahry’s next
//stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without resistance.

// 9556
//As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the wild wizardry died
//back down, Bahry’s dazed mind noticed that the scream was continuing. Only it
//sounded different, like the scream of a young boy, coming from the stairs
//leading down to the next lower level.

// 9557
//That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except for Bahry’s
//frantic panting.

// 9558
//His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent had been
//__insanely__ powerful, that hadn’t been a duel, it had been like his first
//year as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam Tarma. The Death-Eaters hadn’t
//been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye Moody wasn’t that good… and who, what, how in
//the name of Merlin’s balls had anyone blocked a __Killing Curse?__

// 9559
//Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his rib, mutter
//the healing spell, and then press it again to his shoulder. It took more out of
//him than it should have, took far too much out of him, his magic was within a
//bare breath of utter exhaustion; he didn’t have anything left for his minor
//cuts and bruises or even to reinforce the scraps left of his shielding. It was
//all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.

// 9560
//Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as he could before
//he spoke.

// 9561
//“You,” Bahry said. “Whoever you are. Come out.”

// 9562
//There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was might be
//unconscious. He didn’t understand what had just happened, but he’d heard the
//scream…

// 9563
//Well, there was one way to test that.

// 9564
//“Come out,” said Bahry, making his voice harder, “or I start using area-effect
//curses.” He probably couldn’t have managed one if he’d tried.

// 9565
//“Wait,” said a boy’s voice, a __young__ boy’s voice, high and thin and
//wavering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or tears. The voice now
//seemed to be coming from closer to hand. “Please wait. I’m - coming out -”

// 9566
//“Drop the invisibility,” growled Bahry. He was too tired to bother with
//anti-Disillusionment Charms.

// 9567
//A moment later, a young boy’s face emerged from within an unfolding
//invisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the green eyes, the glasses,
//and the angry red lightning-bolt scar.

// 9568
//If he’d had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he might have
//blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably shouldn’t ought to say
//in front of the Boy-Who-Lived.

// 9569
//“He, he,” the boy’s wavering voice said, his young face looked frightened and
//exhausted and tears were still trickling down his cheeks, “he kidnapped me, to
//make me cast my Patronus… he said he’d kill me if I didn’t… only I couldn’t let
//him just kill you…”

// 9570
//Bahry’s mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to click into
//place.

// 9571
//Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse. Bahry might have
//been able to dodge the green death, he’d certainly been trying, but if the
//matter came up before the Wizengamot, they’d rule it was a life debt to a Noble
//House.

// 9572
//“I see,” Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk toward the boy.
//“Son, I’m sorry for what you’ve been through, but I need you to drop the cloak
//and drop your wand.”

// 9573
//The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the sweat-soaked
//blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand clutching an eleven-inch holly
//wand so hard his knuckles were white.

// 9574
//“Your wand,” Bahry repeated.

// 9575
//“Sorry,” whispered the eleven-year-old boy, “here,” and he held out the wand
//toward Bahry.

// 9576
//Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized boy who’d just
//saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with a sigh, and just stretched
//out a hand to take the wand. “Look, son, you’re __really__ not supposed to
//point a wand at -”

// 9577
//The wand’s end twisted lightly beneath Bahry’s hand just as the boy whispered,
//“__Somnium__.”

// 9578
//Harry stared at the Auror’s crumpled body, there was no sense of triumph, just
//a crushing sense of despair.

// 9579
//(Even then it might not have been too late.)

// 9580
//Harry turned to look at where the green snake lay motionless.

// 9581
//“__Teacher?__” hissed Harry. ”__Friend? Pleasse, are you alive?__” An
//awful fear was taking hold in Harry’s heart; in that moment he had entirely
//forgotten that he’d just seen the Defense Professor try to kill a police
//officer.

// 9582
//Harry pointed his wand at the snake, and his lips even began to shape the word
//__Innervate__, before his brain caught up with him and screamed at him.

// 9583
//He didn’t dare use magic on Professor Quirrell.

// 9584
//Harry had felt it, the burning, tearing pain in his head, like his brain was
//about to split in half. He’d felt it, his magic and Professor Quirrell’s magic,
//matched and anti-harmonized in a fulfillment of doom. That was the mysterious
//terrible thing that would happen if Harry and Professor Quirrell ever got too
//close to each other, or if they ever cast magic on each other, or if
//__their spells ever touched,__ their magic would resonate out of control -

// 9585
//Harry stared at the snake, he couldn’t tell if it was breathing.

// 9586
//(The last seconds ticked away.)

// 9587
//He turned to stare at the Auror, who had seen the Boy-Who-Lived, who knew.

// 9588
//The full magnitude of the disaster crushed in on Harry like a thousand
//hundred-ton weights, he’d managed to stun the Auror but now there was nothing
//left to do, no way to recover, the mission had failed, everything had failed,
//__he__ had failed.

// 9589
//Shocked, dismayed, despairing, he __didn’t think of it__, didn’t see the
//obvious, didn’t remember where the hopeless feelings were coming from, didn’t
//realize that he still needed to recast the True Patronus Charm.

// 9590
//(And then it was already too late.)

// 9591
//Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around the table, and
//so they both saw it at the same time, the naked, skeletally thin horror rising
//up to hover outside the window, the headache already hitting them from seeing
//it.

// 9592
//They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken words and those
//words themselves had aged and died.

// 9593
//The Dementor’s speech hurt their ears as it said, “Bellatrix Black is out of
//her cell.”

// 9594
//There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore out of his
//chair, heading for the communicator to call in reinforcements from the
//Ministry, even as McCusker grabbed his mirror and started frantically trying to
//raise the three Aurors who’d gone on patrol.
