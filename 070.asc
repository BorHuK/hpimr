//== Self Actualization, Pt 5

// 12192
//Even if you had been the Deputy Headmistress for three decades, and a
//Transfiguration Professor before that, it was rare that you saw Albus
//Dumbledore caught completely flatfooted.

// 12193
//“…Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and Daphne Greengrass,” Minerva finished. “I
//should also note, Albus, that Miss Granger’s account of your seemingly
//unsupportive attitude - I believe her phrase was ‘he said I should be happy to
//be just a sidekick’ - has generated a good deal of __interest__ among the
//older girls. Several of whom came to me to ask if Miss Granger’s accusations
//were true, since Miss Granger had said that I was there.”

// 12194
//The old wizard leaned back in his huge chair, still gazing at her, his eyes
//looking rather abstracted beneath the half-moon glasses.

// 12195
//“It placed me in something of a dilemma, Albus,” said Professor McGonagall. Her
//face stayed quite neutral, she made sure of that. “I now know that you did not
//truly mean to discourage the girl. Quite the opposite, in fact. But you and
//Severus have often told me that to keep a secret I must give no sign that
//differs from the reaction of someone truly ignorant. Thus I had no choice but
//to confirm that Miss Granger’s account was accurate, and feign the appropriate
//degree of worry, with a slight overtone of offense. After all, had I
//__not__ known you were deliberately manipulating Miss Granger, I might
//have been rather put out.”

// 12196
//“I… see,” the old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently with his silver
//beard, small quick gestures.

// 12197
//“Thankfully,” Professor McGonagall continued, “so far Professors Sinistra and
//Vector are the only two faculty members to don Miss Granger’s buttons.”

// 12198
//“Buttons?” repeated the old wizard.

// 12199
//Minerva drew forth a small silver disc bearing the initials S.P.H.E.W., laid it
//on Albus’s desk, and gave it a brief tap with her finger.

// 12200
//And the voices of Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown,
//Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis cried out in
//unison, “__We won’t settle for second best, it’s time to give a witch a
//quest!__”

// 12201
//“Miss Granger is selling them for two Sickles, and tells me that she has so far
//sold fifty of them. I believe that Nymphadora Tonks, in seventh-year
//Hufflepuff, is enchanting them for her. To conclude my report,” Professor
//McGonagall said briskly, “our eight newly minted heroines have asked permission
//to conduct a protest outside the entrance to your office.”

// 12202
//“I hope,” Albus said, frowning, “you explained to them that -”

// 12203
//“I explained to them that Wednesday at 7PM would be fine,” said Minerva. She
//took back the button from the Headmaster’s desk, favored Albus with a honeyed
//smile, and turned to the door.

// 12204
//“Minerva?” said the old wizard from behind her. “__Minerva!__”

// 12205
//The oaken door shut solidly behind her.

// 12206
//There wasn’t a lot of room between the brief stone walls that demarcated the
//vestibule to the Headmaster’s office, so although a lot of people had wanted to
//watch the protest, not many had been allowed to come. Just Professor Sinistra
//and Professor Vector, who were wearing the buttons, and the prefects Penelope
//Clearwater and Rose Brown and Jacqueline Preece, who were wearing the buttons.
//Behind __them,__ Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout and Professor
//Flitwick, who weren’t wearing the buttons, scrutinizing the whole affair. Harry
//Potter and the Head Boy of Hogwarts were there, and the boy prefects Percy
//Weasley and Oliver Beatson, all wearing the buttons to show Solidarity. And of
//course the eight founding members of S.P.H.E.W., forming a picket line next to
//the gargoyles with their signs. Hermione’s own sign, attached to a solid wooden
//handle which seemed to weigh heavier and heavier in her hands as the seconds
//passed, said NOBODY’S SIDEKICK.

// 12207
//And Professor Quirrell, who was leaning with his back against the far stone
//wall and watching with unreadable eyes. The Defense Professor had gotten one of
//her buttons, though she’d never sold one to him; and he wasn’t wearing it, but
//idly tossing it with one hand.

// 12208
//This whole idea had seemed like a much better idea four days ago, when the
//fires of her indignation had been burning fresh and hot, and she’d been facing
//the prospect of doing it all four days __later __instead of __right
//now.__

// 12209
//But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they carried on, and
//also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to tell everyone she was
//calling it off. Hermione wondered how much heroism had gone on for reasons like
//that. Most books didn’t __say__ “And then they refused to give up, no
//matter how sensible it would have been, because that would’ve been too
//embarrassing”; but a great deal of history made a lot more sense that way.

// 12210
//At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall had told her, Headmaster Dumbledore would come
//down and talk to them for a couple of minutes. Professor McGonagall had said
//not to be frightened - the Headmaster was a good person deep down, and they’d
//properly gotten the school’s authorization for the protest.

// 12211
//But Hermione was very very aware that even if she was doing it with signed
//permission, she was still Defying Authority.

// 12212
//After she’d decided to be a hero, Hermione had done the obvious thing, and gone
//to the Hogwarts library and taken out books on how to be a hero. Then she’d
//returned those books back to their shelves, because it’d been patently obvious
//that none of the authors had been actual heroes themselves. Instead she’d just
//read five times over, until she’d memorized every word, the thirty inches by
//Godric Gryffindor that was all his autobiography and his life’s advice. (Or the
//English translation, anyway; she couldn’t read Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor’s
//autobiography had been a lot more __compressed__ than the books Hermione
//was used to reading, he used __one sentence__ to say things that should’ve
//taken thirty inches just by themselves, and then there was __another__
//sentence after that…

// 12213
//But it was clear from what she’d read that, while Defying Authority wasn’t the
//__point__ of being a hero, you couldn’t be a hero if you were too scared
//to do it. And Hermione Granger knew by now how others saw her, and she knew
//what other people thought she couldn’t do.

// 12214
//Hermione hefted her picket sign a little higher and concentrated on breathing
//slowly and rhythmically instead of hyperventilating until she fell over.

// 12215
//“__Really?__” said Miss Preece in a tone of undisguised fascination. “They
//couldn’t __vote?__”

// 12216
//“Indeed,” said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor’s hair was still
//dark, and her dark face only slightly lined; Hermione __would__ have
//guessed her age at around seventy, except -) “I quite remember my mother’s
//rejoicing when they announced the Qualification of Women Act, although she did
//not actually qualify.” (Which meant that Professor Sinistra had been around her
//Muggle family in 1918.) “And that wasn’t the worst of it. Why, just a few
//centuries earlier -”

// 12217
//Thirty seconds later all the non-Muggleborns, male and female both, were
//staring at Professor Sinistra with utterly shocked expressions. Hannah had
//dropped her sign.

// 12218
//“And __that__ wasn’t the worst of it either, not by half,” finished
//Professor Sinistra. “But you see where this sort of thing could potentially
//lead.”

// 12219
//“Merlin preserve us,” said Penelope Clearwater in a strangled voice. “You mean
//__that’s__ how men would treat us if we didn’t have wands to defend
//ourselves?”

// 12220
//“__Hey!__” said one of the boy prefects. ”__That’s__ not -”

// 12221
//There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of Professor Quirrell.
//When Hermione turned her head to look she saw that the Defense Professor was
//still idly toying with the button, not bothering to glance up at the rest of
//them, as he said, “Such is human nature, Miss Clearwater. Rest assured that
//__you__ would be no kinder, if witches had wands and men lacked them.”

// 12222
//“I hardly think so!” snapped Professor Sinistra.

// 12223
//A cold chuckle. “I suspect it happens more often than any dare suggest, in the
//proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch spies a handsome Muggle; and
//thinks how very easy it would be, to slip the man a love potion, and by him be
//adored alone and utterly. And since she knows he can offer her no resistance,
//why, it is only natural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -”

// 12224
//“__Professor Quirrell!__” said Professor McGonagall sharply.

// 12225
//“I’m sorry,” Professor Quirrell said mildly, his eyes still looking down on the
//button in his hand, “are we all still pretending it doesn’t happen? My
//apologies, then.”

// 12226
//Professor Sinistra snapped, “And I suppose that wizards don’t -”

// 12227
//“There are __children__ present, Professors!” Again Professor McGonagall.

// 12228
//“Some do,” Professor Quirrell said equably, as though discussing the weather.
//“Although personally, I don’t.”

// 12229
//There was a bit of silence, for a time. Hermione put up her sign again - it had
//slipped down to her shoulder while she was listening. She’d never thought of
//that, not even a little, and now she was trying __not__ to think of it,
//and her stomach was feeling a bit queasy. She looked in Harry Potter’s
//direction, not quite knowing why she did; and she saw that Harry’s face was
//perfectly still. A chill ran down her spine before she looked away, not quite
//fast enough to miss the small nod that Harry gave her, as though they were
//agreeing on something.

// 12230
//“To be fair,” Professor Sinistra said after a while, “since I received my
//Hogwarts letter I can’t recall encountering any prejudice on account of being a
//woman, or colored. No, now it is all for being a Muggleborn. I believe Miss
//Granger said that it was __just__ with heroes that she found a problem, so
//far?”

// 12231
//It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she’d been asked the question, and
//then she said “Yes,” in a tone that squeaked a little. This whole thing had
//blown up a bit larger than she’d imagined when she’d started it.

// 12232
//“What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?” said Professor Vector. She looked
//older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting to gray a little; Hermione
//hadn’t ever come close to Professor Vector in person until the Arithmancy
//Professor had asked her for a button.

// 12233
//“Um,” Hermione said, her voice a little high, “I checked the history books and
//there’s been as many woman Ministers of Magic as men. Then I looked at Supreme
//Mugwumps and there were a few more wizards than witches but not many. But if
//you look at people like famous Dark Wizard hunters, or people who’ve stopped
//invasions of Dark creatures, or people who’ve overthrown Dark Lords -”

// 12234
//“And the Dark Wizards themselves, of course,” said Professor Quirrell.
//__Now__ the Defense Professor had looked up. “You may add that to your
//list, Miss Granger. Among all the suspected Death Eaters we know of only two
//sorceresses, Bellatrix Black and Alecto Carrow. And I daresay that most wizards
//would be hard-pressed to name a single Dark Lady besides Baba Yaga.”

// 12235
//Hermione just stared at him.

// 12236
//He couldn’t __possibly__ be -

// 12237
//“Professor Quirrell,” said Professor Vector, “what exactly are you implying?”

// 12238
//The Defense Professor raised the button so that the golden-lettered S.P.H.E.W.
//faced them, and said, “Heroes,” then turned the button to show its silver
//backside and said, “Dark Wizards. They are similar career paths followed by
//similar people, and one can hardly ask why young witches are turning away from
//one course without considering its reflection.”

// 12239
//“Oh, __now__ I see!” said Tracey Davis, speaking up so suddenly that
//Hermione gave a small startle. “You’re joining our protest because you’re
//worried that not enough girls are becoming Dark Witches!” Then Tracey giggled,
//which Hermione couldn’t have managed at this point if you paid her a million
//pounds sterling.

// 12240
//There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell’s face as he replied, “Not really,
//Miss Davis. In truth I do not care about that sort of thing in the slightest.
//But it is futile to count the witches among Ministers of Magic and other such
//ordinary folk leading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore and
//He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men.” The Defense Professor’s fingers idly
//spun the button, turning it over and over. “Then again, only a very few folk
//ever do anything interesting with their lives. What does it matter to you if
//__they__ are mostly witches or mostly wizards, so long as __you__ are
//not among them? And I suspect you will not be among them, Miss Davis; for
//although you are ambitious, you have no ambition.”

// 12241
//“__That’s not true!__” said Tracey indignantly. “And what’s it mean?”

// 12242
//Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning against the
//wall. “You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and I expect that you will
//grasp at any opportunity for advancement which falls into your hands. But there
//is no great ambition that you are driven to accomplish, and you will not
//__make__ your opportunities. At best you will grasp your way upward into
//Minister of Magic, or some other high position of unimportance, never breaking
//the bounds of your existence.”

// 12243
//Then Professor Quirrell’s gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was looking at
//__her,__ the pale blue eyes staring at her with an awful intensity__
//-__ “Tell me, Miss Granger. Do __you__ have an ambition?”

// 12244
//“Professor -” squeaked the high stern voice of Professor Flitwick, and then her
//Head of House’s voice cut off, and from the side of her vision Hermione saw
//that Harry had laid his hand on Professor Flitwick’s shoulder and was shaking
//his head, face looking very adult.

// 12245
//Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.

// 12246
//“What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?” said the Defense
//Professor, still gazing directly at her. “Why is getting good marks in class no
//longer enough? Is it true greatness that you seek? Does some aspect of the
//world dissatisfy you, that you must remake according to your will? Or is this
//all merely a child’s game to you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only
//about rivaling Harry Potter.”

// 12247
//“I -” said Hermione, her voice so high-pitched it made a sort of peeping sound,
//but then she couldn’t think of what else to say.

// 12248
//“You may take a moment to think, if you like,” said Professor Quirrell.
//“Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday. I hear you are quite
//eloquent in them.”

// 12249
//Everyone was looking at her.

// 12250
//“I -” said Hermione. “I don’t agree with one single thing you just said,
//anywhere.”

// 12251
//“Well spoken,” came Professor McGonagall’s crisp voice.

// 12252
//Professor Quirrell’s gaze did not waver. “That is not six inches, Miss Granger.
//__Something__ drives you to defy the Headmaster’s verdict and gather
//followers about yourself. Perhaps it is something you prefer not to speak
//aloud?”

// 12253
//Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn’t impress Professor Quirrell, but it
//was the correct answer, so she said it. “I don’t think you need ambition to be
//a hero,” Hermione said. Her voice wavered but it didn’t crack. “I think you
//just have to do what’s right. And they’re not my followers, we’re friends.”

// 12254
//Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again. The half-smile had faded
//from his face. “Most folk tell themselves they are doing right, Miss Granger.
//They do not thereby rise above the ordinary.”

// 12255
//Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave. “It’s not
//__about__ being not ordinary,” she said as stoutly as she could. “But I
//think if someone just tries to do what’s right, over and over again, and
//they’re not too lazy to do all the work it takes, and they think about what
//they’re doing, and they’re brave enough to do it even when they’re scared -”
//Hermione paused for an instant, her eyes darting to Tracey and Daphne, “- and
//they cleverly plan how to do it - and they don’t just do what other people do -
//then I think someone like that would already get into enough trouble.”

// 12256
//Some of the girls and boys chuckled, as did Professor McGonagall, who looked
//wry and proud at the same time.

// 12257
//“You may be right about that,” said the Defense Professor, his eyes
//half-lidded. He tossed Hermione the button, and she caught it without thinking.
//“My donation to your cause, Miss Granger. I understand that they are worth two
//Sickles.”

// 12258
//The Defense Professor turned and walked away without another word.

// 12259
//“I thought I was going to faint!” gasped Hannah after his footsteps had faded,
//and she heard some of the other girls letting out their breath or putting down
//their signs for a moment.

// 12260
//“I do __too __have an ambition!” said Tracey, who seemed to be almost on
//the verge of tears. “I’m - I’m - I’ll figure out what it is by tomorrow, but I
//have one, I’m sure!”

// 12261
//“If you really can’t think of anything,” Daphne said, giving Tracey a
//comforting pat on the shoulder, “just go with the oldie but goodie and try to
//take over the world.”

// 12262
//“Hey!” said Susan sharply. “You’re supposed to be heroes now! That means you
//have to be __good!__”

// 12263
//“No, it’s all right,” said Lavender, “I’m pretty sure General Chaos wants to
//take over the world and __he’s__ sort of a good guy.”

// 12264
//More conversation was going on behind the picket line. “My goodness,” said
//Penelope Clearwater. “I think that’s the most __overtly__ evil Defense
//Professor we’ve ever had.”

// 12265
//Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, and the Head Boy said, “You weren’t
//around for Professor Barney,” which made several people twitch.

// 12266
//“Professor Quirrell just __talks__ like that,” said Harry Potter, though
//he sounded less certain than before. “I mean, think about it, he doesn’t
//__do__ anything like what Professor Snape does -”

// 12267
//“Mr. Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite and face stern, “why
//did you ask me to stay silent?”

// 12268
//“Professor Quirrell was testing Hermione to see if he wanted to be her
//mysterious old wizard,” Harry said. “Which totally would not have worked out in
//any way, shape, or form, but she had to answer for herself.”

// 12269
//Hermione blinked.

// 12270
//Then Hermione blinked again, as she realized that it was Professor Quirrell who
//was Harry Potter’s mysterious old wizard, and not Dumbledore at all, and that
//__really wasn’t a good sign -__

// 12271
//A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione, her nerves
//already on edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping her protest sign as her
//other hand darted toward her wand.

// 12272
//The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like rock as it
//moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited only briefly, dead gray eyes
//staring out in silent vigil. Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back
//into place and stepped back into their former positions, the Flowing Stone not
//changing its outward appearance at all as it returned from flexibility to
//motionlessness, and the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was solid once more.

// 12273
//And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that probably only looked
//hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the towering form of Albus Percival
//Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the
//Wizengamot, the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,
//the vanquisher of the Dark Lord Grindelwald and protector of Britain, the
//rediscoverer of the fabled Twelve Uses of Dragon’s Blood, the most powerful
//wizard alive; and he was looking at __her,__ Hermione Jean Granger,
//General of the recently expanded Sunshine Regiment, who was getting the best
//grades in the first year of Hogwarts classes, and who had declared herself a
//heroine.

// 12274
//Even her __name__ was shorter than his.

// 12275
//The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined eyes twinkling
//cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and said, “Hello, Miss
//Granger.”

// 12276
//The odd thing was that it wasn’t nearly as scary as talking to Professor
//Quirrell. “Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore,” Hermione said with only a slight
//quaver in her voice.

// 12277
//“Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, “I think you and I
//may have had a bit of a misunderstanding. I did not mean to imply that you
//could not, or should not be a hero. I certainly did not mean to imply that
//witches in general should not be heroes. Only that you were… a bit young, to be
//thinking of such things.”

// 12278
//Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor McGonagall and saw that
//Professor McGonagall was giving her an encouraging smile - or she was giving
//the two of them __some__ kind of smile, anyway - so Hermione looked back
//at the Headmaster and said, the small quaver in her voice a little larger now,
//“Since you became Headmaster forty years ago, there’ve been eleven students to
//graduate Hogwarts who became heroes, I mean people like Lupe Cazaril and so on,
//and __ten__ of those were boys. Cimorene Linderwall was the only witch.”

// 12279
//“Hm,” said the Headmaster. There was a thoughtful expression on his face; he at
//least __seemed__ to be thinking about it. “Miss Granger, I have never been
//one for tallying such numbers. Often it is too much easier to count than to
//understand. Many good people have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards
//both; those famed as heroes are only one kind of good person, and perhaps not
//the highest. You did not include Alice Longbottom or Lily Potter in your
//reckoning… But leave that aside. Tell me, Miss Granger, did you tally how many
//heroes came out of Hogwarts in the forty years before me? For in that time I
//can recall only three now called heroes; and among those three, no witches at
//all.”

// 12280
//“I’m not trying to say it’s __just__ you!” Hermione said. “Only I think
//maybe a __lot__ of people, like the Headmasters before you too, maybe even
//your whole society and everything, might be discouraging girls.”

// 12281
//The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked only at her, as though they
//were the only two people present. “Miss Granger, it might be possible to
//discourage witches from becoming Charms Mistresses, or Quidditch players, or
//even Aurors. But not heroes. If someone is meant to be a hero then a hero they
//will be. They will walk through fire and swim through ice. Dementors will not
//stop them, nor the deaths of friends, and not discouragement either.”

// 12282
//“Well,” Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words. “Well, I mean…
//what if that’s not __actually__ true? I mean, to __me__ it seems that
//if you want more witches to be heroes, you ought to teach them heroing.”

// 12283
//“Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams,” Dumbledore said quietly. He
//did not look at any of the other girls, only at her. “Fewer in the waking
//world. Many have stood their ground and faced the darkness when it comes for
//them. Fewer come for the darkness and force it to face them. It is a hard life,
//sometimes lonely, often short. I have told none to refuse that calling, but
//neither would I wish to increase their number.”

// 12284
//Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face that stopped her,
//like a hint to all the emotion that wasn’t being displayed, years and years of
//it…

// 12285
//__Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn’t be so lonely, or
//so short.__

// 12286
//She couldn’t bring herself to say that, though, not to him.

// 12287
//“But the point is moot,” said the old wizard. He smiled, a bit ruefully she
//thought. “Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like you would teach Charms.
//You cannot assign twelve inches on how to carry on when all hope seems lost.
//You cannot rehearse students on when to stand up and tell the Headmaster he has
//done wrong. Heroes are born, not taught. And for whatever reason, more of them
//are born boys than girls.” The Headmaster shrugged, as if to say that
//__he__ was helpless to do anything about that.

// 12288
//“Um,” Hermione said. She couldn’t help it, she glanced behind her.

// 12289
//Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant. And it __wasn’t__ true
//that everyone was staring at her like she’d just been silly, the way she’d
//started to imagine while she was listening to Dumbledore.

// 12290
//Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep breath, and said,
//“Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes, will be heroes no matter what.
//But I don’t see how anyone could really __know__ that, aside from just
//saying it afterward. And when __I__ told you that I wanted to be a hero,
//you weren’t very encouraging.”

// 12291
//“Mr. Potter,” the Headmaster said mildly. His eyes didn’t leave hers. “Please
//tell Miss Granger your impression of our own first meeting. Would you say that
//I was encouraging? Speak the truth.”

// 12292
//There was a pause.

// 12293
//“Mr. Potter?” said Professor Vector’s voice from behind her, sounding puzzled.

// 12294
//“Um,” Harry’s voice said from further back, sounding extremely reluctant. “Um…
//well, actually in my case the Headmaster set fire to a chicken.”

// 12295
//“He __what?__” Hermione blurted, only there were several other people
//exclaiming things at around the same time so she wasn’t sure anyone heard her.

// 12296
//Dumbledore went on gazing at her, looking perfectly serious.

// 12297
//“I didn’t know about Fawkes,” Harry’s voice said rapidly, “so he told me that
//Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a chicken on Fawkes’s stand so
//I’d think __that__ was Fawkes, and then he set the chicken on fire - and
//also he gave me this big rock and told me it had belonged to my father and I
//ought to carry it everywhere -”

// 12298
//“But that’s __crazy!__” Susan blurted out.

// 12299
//There was a sudden hush.

// 12300
//The Headmaster slowly turned his head to stare at Susan.

// 12301
//“I -” said Susan. “I mean - I -”

// 12302
//The Headmaster leaned down until he was face-to-face with the young girl.

// 12303
//“I didn’t -” said Susan.

// 12304
//Dumbledore put a finger to his lips and twiddled them, making a
//__bweeble-bweeble-bweeble__ sound.

// 12305
//The Headmaster straightened up again and said, “Well, my good heroines, it has
//been pleasant speaking to you, but alas, much else remains to do this day.
//Still, rest assured that I am inscrutable at everyone, not just witches.”

// 12306
//The gargoyles stepped aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like rock as it moved
//like flesh.

// 12307
//The huge ugly figures waited briefly with dead gray eyes staring out in silent
//vigil, as Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, smiling as benevolently as
//when he’d first emerged from his office, stepped back into the Enchantment of
//the Endless Stair.

// 12308
//Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place and stepped back
//into their former positions, only one last brief “Bwa-ha-ha!” echoing out
//before the gap closed.

// 12309
//There was a long silence.

// 12310
//“He __really__ set a chicken on fire?” said Hannah.

// 12311
//The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but to be honest
//their heart had gone out of it.

// 12312
//It __had__ been established, after some careful questions from Professor
//Flitwick, that Harry Potter hadn’t smelled the chicken burning. Which meant
//that it had probably been a pebble or something, Transfigured into a chicken
//and then enclosed in a Boundary Charm to make sure that no smoke escaped into
//the air - both Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall had been very
//emphatic about nobody trying that without their supervision.

// 12313
//But still…

// 12314
//But still… what?

// 12315
//Hermione didn’t even __know__ but still what.

// 12316
//But __still__.

// 12317
//After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom had wanted to be
//first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest over, and the adults and
//boys had drifted off.

// 12318
//“You don’t think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?” said Susan as the
//heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs of feet trodding on the stone
//paving of Hogwarts’s corridors. “I mean, if he __is__ crazy at everyone
//and not just at witches then it’s not discrimination, right?”

// 12319
//“I don’t want to protest against the Headmaster any more,” Hannah said weakly.
//The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on her feet. “I don’t care what
//Professor McGonagall says about him not holding it against us, it’s just too
//much for my nerves.”

// 12320
//Lavender snorted. “I guess __you__ won’t be slaying armies of Inferi
//anytime soon -”

// 12321
//“Stop that!” Hermione said sharply. “Look, all of us have got to __learn__
//to be heroines, right? It’s okay if someone doesn’t know right away.”

// 12322
//“The Headmaster doesn’t think it __can__ be learned,” Padma said. The
//Ravenclaw girl’s face was thoughtful, her steps measured as she strode through
//the corridor. “The Headmaster doesn’t even think that’s a good idea.”

// 12323
//Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held bolt upright,
//looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts robes than Hermione could
//have done with her best formal dress. “The Headmaster,” Daphne said in a
//precise voice, her shoes making hard, sharp tacking sounds on the stone,
//“thinks the lot of us are a bunch of silly girls playing games, and that
//someday Hermione might make a good sidekick but the rest of us are hopeless.”

// 12324
//“Is he __right?__” said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl’s face was very
//serious, making her look much more like her twin than she usually did. “I mean
//it has to be asked -”

// 12325
//“__No!__” spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking through the hallway
//looking ready to __kill__ someone, like a miniature female Snape. Of all
//the girls, Tracey was the one who Hermione knew least. Hermione had talked to
//Lavender once before, but she’d never really __seen__ Tracey except at
//wandpoint during a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from her sofa to
//volunteer. “We’ll show him! We’ll show them __all!__”

// 12326
//“Okay,” said Susan, “that was __definitely__ evil -”

// 12327
//“No,” said Lavender, “that’s a Chaos Legion motto, actually. Only she didn’t do
//the insane laughter.”

// 12328
//“That’s right,” Tracey said, her voice low and grim. “This time I’m not
//laughing.” The girl went on stalking through the corridor, like she had
//dramatic music accompanying her that only she could hear.

// 12329
//(Hermione was starting to worry about what __exactly __the impressionable
//youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry Potter.)

// 12330
//“But - I mean -” Parvati said. She still had a contemplative look on her face.
//“I mean, you can see __why__ the Headmaster would think we were just silly
//girls, right? What does protesting outside the Headmaster’s office have to do
//with becoming heroines?”

// 12331
//“Huh,” Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. “That’s true. We should
//do something heroic. I mean heroinic.”

// 12332
//“Um -” said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione’s own feelings on the
//subject.

// 12333
//“Well,” said Parvati, “has everyone already been through Dumbledore’s
//third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in Gryffindor’s been through it
//by now -”

// 12334
//“Hold __on!__” Hermione said desperately. “I don’t want you doing anything
//__dangerous!__”

// 12335
//There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was realizing, much
//too late, why Dumbledore hadn’t wanted anyone __else __to be a hero.

// 12336
//“I don’t think you can become a heroine if you never do anything dangerous,”
//Lavender observed reasonably.

// 12337
//“Besides,” said Padma, a considering look on her face. “Everyone knows that
//nothing __really__ bad ever happens in Hogwarts, right? To students, I
//mean, not to the Defense Professors. We’ve got all these ancient wards and so
//on.”

// 12338
//“Um -” Hannah said again.

// 12339
//“Yeah,” said Parvati, “the worst that can happen is that we’ll lose a few dozen
//House points or something, and there’s two of us from each House so
//__that’ll __all come out even.”

// 12340
//“Why, that’s __brilliant,__ Hermione!” said Daphne in a tone of great
//amazement. “The way you set it up means we can get away with __anything!__
//And I didn’t even notice your cunning plan until now!”

// 12341
//“__UM__ -” said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan.

// 12342
//“Right!” said Parvati. “So now it’s time for us to become real heroines. We’ll
//come for the darkness -”

// 12343
//“And make __it__ face __us __-” said Lavender.

// 12344
//“And teach it to be afraid,” Tracey Davis said grimly.
