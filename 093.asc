//== Roles, Pt 4

// 16609
//Harry had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once, grabbed enough
//calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on his Cloak again and found a
//small random corner in which to eat. Seeing the students at their tables -

// 16610
//__Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a good sign,__
//Hufflepuff said. __It’s not reasonable to blame them for having not had
//your opportunities to learn what you’ve learned. Inaction in emergencies has
//nothing to do with people being selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash
//in Tener-something where a few people ran out and escaped but most people just
//sat in their seats not moving while their plane was literally on fire. Look at
//how long __you__ took to really start moving.__

// 16611
//__It serves no useful purpose to hate__, said Gryffindor. __It’s
//just going to damage your altruism.__

// 16612
//__Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent this from
//happening next time,__ said Ravenclaw.

// 16613
//__I’ll go ahead and register the experimental prediction,__ said
//Slytherin, __that we’ll always observe exactly what would be predicted on
//the hypothesis that people cannot be saved, cannot be taught, and will never
//help us with anything important. Also, we need some way of keeping track of all
//the times I’m right.__

// 16614
//Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of toast as fast as he
//could. It wasn’t proper nutrition as a general policy, but one-time exceptions
//wouldn’t hurt so long as he made them up the next day.

// 16615
//In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phoenix flew in from nowhere
//and said, in the voice of a tired old man, “Please remove your Cloak, Harry, I
//have a letter to deliver to you.”

// 16616
//Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone down the wrong
//way, stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility, said aloud “Tell Dumbledore
//I said fine,” and then sat down and continued to eat his toast.

// 16617
//The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up to Harry’s nook,
//carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real paper, with lines, not
//wizard’s parchment.

// 16618
//“Is that -” Harry said.

// 16619
//“From your father, and from your mother,” said the old wizard. Wordlessly,
//Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and wordlessly Harry accepted them.
//The old wizard hesitated, then said quietly, “The Defense Professor has told me
//to restrain my counsel, and I thought the same thing myself when given time to
//think. I have always taken too long to learn the virtues of silence. But if I
//am mistaken, you need only say the word -”

// 16620
//“You’re not mistaken,” Harry said. He looked down at the folded, lined papers,
//feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body indicated a strong
//pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn’t actually disown him, and there
//wasn’t much they could __do__ to him (some part of himself was still
//afraid in a very visceral way of television privileges being taken away, no
//matter how little sense that made now). But he had stepped outside the role
//that parents would expect of children who, in their internal beliefs, were
//lower on the pecking order. It would be stupid to expect anything except
//complete indignant fury, all-out righteous rage, when you acted like that to
//someone who thought they were dominant over you.

// 16621
//“After you read it,” the Headmaster said, “I believe that you should come to
//the Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an announcement which you will wish to
//hear.”

// 16622
//“I’m not interested in funerals -”

// 16623
//“No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done reading, and do so
//without your Cloak. Will you?”

// 16624
//“Yes.”

// 16625
//The old wizard left.

// 16626
//Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important thing was
//keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of harm’s way, it might be a
//cliche but so far as Harry could tell the logic was valid. Damaged
//relationships could be repaired later.

// 16627
//The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a careful focus for
//Harry to read,

// 16628
//__Son,__

// 16629
//__No matter what you’ve read in books, keeping us out of harm’s way is
//____not____ as important as having adults who can help when you’re in
//trouble. You decided without giving us a word in edgewise that we’d abandon you
//because of your ‘dark side’. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I’ve seen
//things in this last year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy - sometimes I
//wonder if your Mum isn’t just humoring me and the authorities took you away
//when I started thinking you were a magic-user - so I can’t deny that it’s
//____possible____ you’ve managed to develop some… I’m not quite sure
//what to call it, but ‘dark side’ seems premature if we don’t know what’s
//happening. Are you sure it’s not a burgeoning telepathic talent and you’re just
//picking up on the minds of other wizards around you? Their thoughts might seem
//evil to a child who grew up in a saner civilization. These are ungrounded
//speculations, I admit, but you shouldn’t jump to conclusions either.__

// 16630
//__The two most important things I have to tell you are this. First, son,
//I have ____every____ confidence in your ability to stay on the Light
//Side of the Force so long as you choose to, and I have every confidence that
//you will choose to. If there’s some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions
//in your ears, just ignore the suggestions. I ____do____ feel the need
//to emphasize that you should exercise special caution to ignore this evil
//spirit even if it is suggesting what seem like wonderful creative ideas and I
//hope I do not need to remind you about the Incident with the Science Project
//which would, I admit, make a deal more sense if you were struggling with
//demonic possession.__

// 16631
//__The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to fear that Mum
//or I are going to abandon you because of your ‘dark side’. We may not have
//expected you to gain magical powers or develop an affinity for black magic, but
//we did expect you to become a teenager. Which, if you think about it from your
//poor father’s perspective, is already a sufficiently worrying prospect
//regarding a child who, by the age of nine, had been party to the summoning of a
//total of five fire engines. Children grow up. I won’t lie to you and say that
//you will feel as close to us at 20 as you do now. But your Mum and I will feel
//just as close to you when we are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home
//robots. Children always grow up and away from their parents, and the parents
//always follow them from behind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up, and
//their personalities change, and they do things that their parents wish they
//would not do, and they act disrespectfully toward their parents and have them
//hauled out of their magical schools, and the parents go on loving them anyway.
//It is Nature’s way. Though in the event that you have not yet hit puberty and
//your teenage years are proportionately worse than this, we reserve the right to
//reconsider this sentiment.__

// 16632
//__No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and will always
//love you no matter what. I don’t know if our love has any magical power under
//your rules, but if it does, don’t hesitate to call on it.__

// 16633
//__With all of this said… Harry, what you did there is not acceptable. I
//think you know that. And I also know that it is not the time to lecture you on
//it. But you must write and tell us what is happening. I can understand very
//well why you’d want us taken out of your school at once, and I know we can’t
//force you to do anything, but please, Harry, be reasonable and realize how
//terrified we must be.__

// 16634
//__I would like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden to mess
//around with any magic that the adults around you consider the least bit unsafe,
//but for all I know, the teachers at your school are giving everyone lessons in
//advanced necromancy every Monday. Please, please exercise as much caution as
//your situation permits, whatever your situation may be. Despite your very
//hurried summary we don’t have the slightest idea what is happening and I hope
//that you will write us as much as you can. It is clear that you are, at least
//in some ways, growing up, and I will ____try____ not to act like the
//children’s-book parent who only makes things worse - though I hope you
//appreciate how hard this is - and your Mum has said a number of frightening
//things to me about how wizardry stays secret and how I might get
//____you____ into trouble by making waves. I cannot tell you to avoid
//anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and your Headmaster will not let
//you leave. I can’t tell you that you shouldn’t take responsibility for anything
//happening around you, because for all I know there are other children in
//trouble. But remember that it is ____not____ your moral
//responsibility to protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and every
//good adult would agree with that. Please write and tell us more as soon as you
//can.__

// 16635
//__Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at all that we
//can do, please let us know at once. There is nothing which can happen to us
//which would be worse than learning that something had happened to you.__

// 16636
//__Love,__

// 16637
//______Dad.______

// 16638
//____

// 16639
//The last page said only,

// 16640
//__You promised me that you wouldn’t let magic take you away from me. I
//didn’t raise you to be a boy who would break a promise to his Mum. You must
//come back safely, because you promised.__

// 16641
//__Love,__

// 16642
//______Mum.______

// 16643
//____

// 16644
//Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the Great Hall. His
//hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and it seemed to be taking a
//very great deal of effort not to cry; which he knew wordlessly that he must not
//do. He hadn’t cried through all of the day. And he wouldn’t cry. Crying was the
//same as admitting defeat. And this wasn’t over. So he wouldn’t cry.

// 16645
//The food served in the Great Hall that evening was plain that night, toast and
//butter and jam, water and orange juice, oatmeal and other simple fare, without
//dessert. Some students had worn simple black robes without their House colors.
//Others had still worn theirs. It should have been cause for argument, but there
//was instead a quietness, the sound of people eating without talking. It took
//two sides to make a debate, and one of the sides, this night, was not much
//interested in debating.

// 16646
//Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat at the Head Table and did not eat.
//She should have. Perhaps she would in a short while. But she could not force
//herself to do it now.

// 16647
//For a Gryffindor there was only one path. It had taken Minerva only a short
//time to remember that, when after the Defense Professor’s urgings her mind had
//stayed empty of clever plots to try. That was not a Gryffindor’s way; or
//perhaps she ought to say only that it was not __her__ way, Albus did seem
//to try his hand at plotting… and yet when she thought back on their history,
//there were no plots at the moment of crisis, no cleverness and games in the
//last resort. For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the rule __in extremis__
//was to decide what was the right thing to do, and do it no matter the cost to
//yourself. Even if it meant breaking your bounds, or changing your role, or
//letting go of your picture of yourself. That was the last resort of Gryffindor.

// 16648
//Through a side entrance of the Great Hall she saw Harry Potter quietly slip in.

// 16649
//It was time.

// 16650
//Professor Minerva McGonagall rose from her chair, straightened the worn point
//on her hat, walked slowly to the lectern before the Head Table.

// 16651
//The sounds in the Great Hall, already muted, fell away entirely as all students
//turned to look at her.

// 16652
//“By now you have all heard,” she said, her voice not quite steady. __That
//Hermione Granger is dead.__ She didn’t say those words aloud, since they had all
//heard. “Somehow, a troll was infiltrated into the castle Hogwarts without alarm
//from our ancient wards. Somehow this troll succeeded in injuring a student,
//without alarm from the wards until the point of her death. Investigations are
//underway to determine how this has occurred. The Board of Governors is meeting
//to determine how Hogwarts will respond. In due time justice shall be served.
//Meanwhile there is another matter of justice, which must be handled at once.
//George Weasley, Fred Weasley, please come forward to stand before us all.”

// 16653
//The Weasley twins exchanged glances where they sat at the Gryffindor table, and
//then stood up and walked toward her, slowly, reluctantly; and Minerva realized
//then that the Weasley twins thought that they were to be expelled.

// 16654
//They honestly thought that she would expel them.

// 16655
//That was what the picture of Professor McGonagall who lived in her head had
//wrought.

// 16656
//The Weasley twins walked over to the lectern, looking up at her with faces that
//were frightened, but resolute; and she felt something in her heart break a
//little further.

// 16657
//“I am not going to expel you,” she said, and was saddened further by the
//surprised look on their faces. “Fred Weasley, George Weasley, turn and face
//your classmates, let them see you.”

// 16658
//Still looking surprised, the Weasley twins did so.

// 16659
//She drew up all the steel in her heart, and said what was right.

// 16660
//“I am ashamed,” said Minerva McGonagall, “of the events of this day. I am
//ashamed that there were only two of you. Ashamed of what I have done to
//Gryffindor. Of all the Houses, it should have been Gryffindor to help when
//Hermione Granger was in need, when Harry Potter called for the brave to aid
//him. It was true, a seventh-year could have held back a mountain troll while
//searching for Miss Granger. And you should have believed that the Head of House
//Gryffindor,” her voice broke, “would have believed in you. If you disobeyed her
//to do what was right, in events she had not foreseen. And the reason you did
//not believe this, is that I have never shown it to you. I did not believe in
//you. I did not believe in the virtues of Gryffindor itself. I tried to stamp
//out your defiance, instead of training your courage to wisdom. Whatever the
//Sorting Hat saw in me that led it to place me in Gryffindor, I have betrayed
//it. I have offered my resignation to the Headmaster as Deputy Headmistress and
//as the Head of House Gryffindor.”

// 16661
//There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the Gryffindor Table,
//as Harry’s heart froze within his chest. Harry needed to run forward, say
//something, he hadn’t meant for __this__ to -

// 16662
//Minerva took another breath, and continued. “However, the Headmaster has
//declined to accept my resignation,” she said. “So I will continue to serve, and
//try to undo what I have wrought. Somehow I must find a way to teach my students
//how to do what is right. Not what is safe, not what is easy, not what we are
//told to do. If all I can teach you is to turn in your essays on time, there
//might as well not be a House Gryffindor. This road will be more difficult for
//me, and maybe for all of us. But I know now that before I was only taking the
//easy path.”

// 16663
//She stepped down from the lectern, moved down to where the Weasley twins stood.

// 16664
//“Fred Weasley, George Weasley,” she said. “The two of you have not always done
//what is right. The path of wisdom does not lie in flagrant and needless
//defiance of authority. And yet today you proved to be the last of our House to
//survive my mistakes. Because it was the right thing to do, you defied a threat
//of expulsion and risked your lives to face a mountain troll. For your
//astounding courage that honors your House to have you, I award each of you two
//hundred points for Gryffindor.”

// 16665
//Again the look of shock on their faces, again the pain like a knife through her
//heart.

// 16666
//She turned to face the other students.

// 16667
//“I will not award any points to Ravenclaw,” she said. “I suspect that Mr.
//Potter would not want them. If I am wrong, he may correct me and take as many
//House points as he pleases. But for whatever it is worth, Mr. Potter, I am,”
//her voice faltered, “I am sorry -”

// 16668
//“__Stop!__” Harry screamed, and then, again, “Stop.” The word sticking in
//his throat. “You don’t have to, Professor.” Something inside him was twisting,
//threatening to split him open, like a giant’s hands wrenching at him to tear
//him in half. “And, and you shouldn’t forget Susan Bones, and Ron Weasley - they
//also helped, they should get House points too -”

// 16669
//“Miss Bones and the young Weasley?” said Professor McGonagall. “Rubeus said
//nothing of that - what did they do?”

// 16670
//__“__Miss Bones tried to stun Mr. Hagrid when he tried to stop me, and Mr.
//Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop me. They should both get
//points, and, and so should Neville,” Harry hadn’t thought to imagine it before,
//the way Neville must be feeling now, but the instant he’d thought, he knew,
//“because Neville tried to do something, even if it wasn’t the right thing,
//doing what’s right is the __second__ lesson, you can start practicing that
//after you learn to do anything at all -”

// 16671
//“Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice
//breaking in the middle. “Ten points to Gryffindor, Ron Weasley, your family has
//done itself exceeding proud, this day. And ten points to Hufflepuff for Neville
//Longbottom, for standing up to Mr. Potter and doing what he thought was right
//-”

// 16672
//__“You shouldn’t!__” screamed a young voice from the Hufflepuff table,
//followed by a single choking sound.

// 16673
//Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor McGonagall and
//said, as steadily as he could, “Neville’s right, actually, you can’t award
//literally zero points for the part where you get the action correct, that sends
//the wrong message too, but he was halfway there so it could be five points
//instead.”

// 16674
//Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn’t think of what to
//say; but then her eyes went to Neville’s place at the table, and she said, “As
//you wish, Mr. Potter. What is it, Miss Bones?”

// 16675
//Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward, wiping at her own
//eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, “Actually - Professor McGonagall - General
//Potter didn’t see it - but Captain Weasley and I weren’t the only ones who
//tried to get in Mr. Hagrid’s way, after he ran out. Before some of the older
//students stopped us. But we managed to slow Mr. Hagrid down a minute, so
//General Potter could get away.”

// 16676
//“You’ve got to give them points too,” said Ron Weasley from the Gryffindor
//table. “Or I won’t take any.”

// 16677
//“Who else?” said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit unsteady.

// 16678
//Seven other children stood up.

// 16679
//__What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting nothing
//would ever work?__ said Hufflepuff.

// 16680
//Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his force to hold
//himself together.

// 16681
//When all had been said, and all had been done, Minerva went to where Harry
//Potter stood. Though it was not her greatest skill she cast a ward about them
//to blur vision, and muffled sounds with another thought.

// 16682
//“You, you didn’t have to -” said Harry Potter. “You shouldn’t have said -” He
//sounded like he was choking. “P-Professor, everything I said to you was
//hurtful, and hateful, and wrong -”

// 16683
//“I already knew that, Harry,” she said. “Even so, I wished to do better.” There
//was a feeling of lightness in her chest, much as one might experience after
//stepping off a cliff, when your legs no longer had to hold your body upright.
//She wasn’t sure she could do this, she did not know the way; and yet for the
//first time it seemed possible that Hogwarts wouldn’t become a sad ghost of its
//former self, when she became its Headmistress.

// 16684
//Harry stared at her, then made a odd noise that sounded like it had been forced
//from his throat, and covered his face in his hands.

// 16685
//So she knelt down, and hugged him. It might go wrong, but it might also go
//right, and she would not let that uncertainty stop her; it was time she began
//to learn a Gryffindor’s courage, so that she could teach it in turn.

// 16686
//“I had a sister once,” she whispered. Just that, and nothing more.

// 16687
//__Just to make sure,__ said some part of Harry, while the rest of him
//sobbed into Professor McGonagall’s arms, __this doesn’t mean we’ve
//accepted Hermione’s death, right?__

// 16688
//__NO__ said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in unanimous
//agreement, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel. __Never, ever,
//forever.__

// 16689
//And an ancient wizard to whom that ward meant nothing gazed upon them both, the
//witch and the weeping young wizard. Albus Dumbledore was smiling with a strange
//sad look in his eyes, like someone who has taken one more step toward a
//foreseen destination.

// 16690
//The Defense Professor watched them both, the woman and the crying boy. His eyes
//were very cold, and very calculating.

// 16691
//He did not think that this would be enough.

// 16692
//It wasn’t until the next morning that it was discovered that Hermione Granger’s
//body was missing.
