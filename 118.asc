//== Something to Protect: Professor Quirrell

// 19462
//The Sun shone down on the Scottish green, striking sparks of reflected white
//from every passing dewdrop or reflective leaf that happened to position itself
//correctly, a clear blue sky for a funeral.

// 19463
//Harry had declined to give the eulogy. He’d declined for the second time.
//Professor Flitwick had asked him about it weeks ago in May, to give Harry time
//to write his lines before it would become necessary to speak; and Harry had
//said no then, too.

// 19464
//So it fell to a sixth-year Gryffindor, Oliver Habryka, who had the
//fourth-highest total of Quirrell points among all the students, and who had
//been General of an army. The seventeen-year-old boy was tall and not especially
//handsome in solid black robes; instead of a red tie, he was wearing a purple
//tie such as Professor Quirrell had sometimes favored.

// 19465
//Speaking, under the circumstances, __ex tempore.__ The previous eulogies,
//written well in advance, had been discarded; Oliver Habryka had a parchment in
//his left hand, but he wasn’t looking at it at all.

// 19466
//“Professor Quirrell was very sick,” the tall boy said, his wavering voice
//falling into a hush of students, occasionally broken by a muffled sob. “I think
//if Professor Quirrell had been able to fight in the fullness of his power,
//You-Know-Who couldn’t have beat him easily, and maybe not at all. They say that
//David Monroe was the only one that You-Know-Who was ever afraid of, in his day.
//But,” Oliver’s voice broke, “Professor Quirrell wasn’t in the fullness of his
//power. He was very sick. He had trouble walking by himself. And he went to face
//the Dark Lord, alone.”

// 19467
//There was a pause, then, while the students cried for a while.

// 19468
//Oliver wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and spoke again. “We don’t know
//exactly what happened,” said Oliver. “I imagine the Dark Lord laughed at him.
//Maybe made fun of the Professor, for challenging him when he couldn’t stand up.
//Well, __he’s not laughing now,__ is he.”

// 19469
//There were fierce nods from the students; all of them that Harry could see,
//from Gryffindor to Slytherin.

// 19470
//“Maybe the Dark Lord knew some way of curing Professor Quirrell, You-Know-Who
//did come back from the dead after all. Maybe he offered Professor Quirrell his
//life if Professor Quirrell would serve him. Professor Quirrell smiled, and told
//the Dark Lord it was time for them to play a game called Who’s The Most
//Dangerous Wizard In The World.”

// 19471
//__If you don’t know, don’t just make stuff up.__ But Harry didn’t say
//anything. It was what Lord Voldemort might have tried, it was what Professor
//Quirrell might have said back.

// 19472
//“And they aren’t telling us everything,” Oliver said, “but we can guess what
//happened next. We all know that Hermione Granger, who was one of the
//Professor’s best students, was killed by a troll earlier this year, it must
//have been the Dark Lord who made it happen, just like he framed her for the
//Blood-Cooling Charm. Professor Quirrell knew the Dark Lord was behind it, so he
//stole Miss Granger’s body and preserved it, kept it safe -”

// 19473
//Couldn’t blame him for that one.

// 19474
//“Then Professor Quirrell went out to face the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord killed
//Professor Quirrell. And Hermione Granger came back to life. They say she’s
//alive and whole now, and maybe something more. When the Dark Lord tried to
//seize her, all that was left of him afterward was his burned robes and his
//hands around Miss Granger’s throat. Just as Harry Potter was protected from the
//Killing Curse by his mother’s love and sacrifice, Professor Quirrell willingly
//going out, to face, the Dark Lord alone, must have called, Hermione Granger’s
//spirit, back from, from wherever, she was -” Oliver’s voice was breaking.

// 19475
//“Not just like that,” Harry said from the front row of seats, his own voice
//hoarse. He __had__ to say something at this point, before it got out of
//control. If it wasn’t already out of control. “David Monroe was a powerful
//wizard, more powerful than anyone knew except him and me. I don’t think you can
//bring someone back from the dead just by sacrificing yourself. No one should
//try doing it that way.”

// 19476
//Such a beautiful story. It should have been true. __It should have been
//true.__

// 19477
//“I don’t know very much about the person behind the Professor,” Oliver Habryka
//said, after he got himself under control again. “I know David Monroe wasn’t a
//happy man. He never could cast a Patronus Charm.”

// 19478
//Tears were gathering in Harry’s eyes again. It wasn’t right, it wasn’t fair,
//Voldemort had killed so many people, he should have died along with his
//followers, he didn’t deserve special treatment. But it hadn’t just been Harry’s
//weakness, it had been the horcruxes, Voldemort __couldn’t__ have been
//killed outright. So Harry could admit it, he was glad, he was __glad__
//Professor Quirrell wasn’t all gone…

// 19479
//“But I, know,” said Oliver, tears glistening on his own cheeks, “Professor
//Quirrell, is happy, wherever, he is now.”

// 19480
//On Harry’s left hand, a tiny emerald glowed bright beneath the morning sun.

// 19481
//__Not Heaven, not some faraway star, not a different place but a better
//person, I’ll show you, someday I’ll show you how to be happy -__

// 19482
//The tall boy glanced down at a parchment he held in his other hand, the first
//time he’d consulted it. “Professor Quirrell,” Oliver said, his voice now
//fiercer and faster, “was, by far, the best Professor of Battle Magic that
//Hogwarts ever had. Salazar Slytherin couldn’t have been half as good a teacher,
//no matter what spells he knew. Professor Quirrell told us at the beginning of
//this year that what he taught us would always be our firm foundation in the
//arts of Defense. And it will be. Forever. We’ll teach it to the new students
//next year, no matter who we have for a professor. The older students will teach
//the younger ones. That’s the solution to the curse on the Defense position. We
//won’t sit around waiting for authority to teach us. And we’ll make sure that
//Professor Quirrell’s teachings never die out of Hogwarts.”

// 19483
//Harry looked at where Professor - no, Headmistress McGonagall - was sitting,
//and saw the Headmistress nodding silently, a look that was sad and stern and
//proud.

// 19484
//“They haven’t let us see Miss Granger yet,” Oliver said. His voice quavered.
//“The Girl-Who-Revived. But I’ll always think of the Defense Professor when I
//see her. His sacrifice lives on in her, just as his teachings live on in us.”
//Oliver glanced at where Harry sat, then looked down again at the parchment.
//“Here’s to Professor Quirrell, then, the best Slytherin that ever was, what
//every Slytherin should be! Three cheers for him!”

// 19485
//__“Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!”__

// 19486
//No one stayed silent this time, not a single student that Harry could see.
