//== TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt 7

// 9968
//Harry had __hoped__ that he’d just achieved fusion with his mysterious
//dark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its benefits with none of its
//drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity and indomitable will on demand, without
//needing to go cold or angry.

// 9969
//Once again, he’d overestimated how much progress he’d made. __Something__
//had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious dark side, it was still separate
//from him, and his ordinary self was still domitable. And despite the repair
//work he’d done on his dark side’s fear of death, he didn’t dare go dark while
//unshielded in Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.

// 9970
//Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would have __sure
//come in handy about now.__

// 9971
//What made it harder was that he couldn’t slump against a wall, couldn’t break
//into tears, couldn’t even heave a sigh. His dear Bella was watching him and
//that wasn’t the sort of thing her Dark Lord would do.

// 9972
//“My Lord -” Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. “The Dementors - they
//are coming - I can feel them, my Lord -”

// 9973
//“Thank you, Bella,” said a dry voice, “I already know that.”

// 9974
//Harry couldn’t sense the holes in the world the same way as when he’d been
//wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty pull increasing in
//intensity. At first he’d mistaken it for the result of descending a stairwell,
//until he and Bellatrix had finished descending and the pull had gone on
//increasing. Then decreased, as the Dementors moved away along the spiral, then
//increased as they went up another flight of stairs… There were Dementors within
//Azkaban itself now, and they were coming for him. Of course they were. Harry
//might be resistant now, but he was not __hidden.__

// 9975
//__New requirement,__ Harry told his brain. __Find a way of defeating
//Dementors that doesn’t invoke my Patronus Charm. Alternatively, find yet
//another way of hiding someone from Dementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility
//-__

// 9976
//__I quit,__ said his brain. __Find yourself another piece of
//computing substrate to solve your ridiculously overconstrained problems.__

// 9977
//__I mean it,__ thought Harry.

// 9978
//__So do I,__ said his brain. __Put up your Patronus Charm and wait
//for the Aurors to find you. Be sensible. It’s over.__

// 9979
//__Give up…__

// 9980
//The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it; and Harry
//realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely on the stars, turned
//his mind away from the despair -

// 9981
//__You know,__ observed the logical side of him, __if you’re not
//allowed to think __any __negative thoughts because that will open your
//mind to the Dementors, __that’s__ a cognitive bias too, how would you know
//if it actually __was__ time to give up?__

// 9982
//A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in like “no” and
//“away”. The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel it.

// 9983
//The Dementors were coming.

// 9984
//“My Lord, you - you should not risk yourself for me - take back your Cloak -”

// 9985
//“Be silent, fool,” hissed an angry voice. “When I decide to sacrifice you I
//will tell you so.”

// 9986
//__She’s got a valid point,__ said Slytherin. __You
//__shouldn’t__ risk yourself for her, there’s no way her life is as
//valuable as yours.__

// 9987
//For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save himself -

// 9988
//And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to flee the
//corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry’s fingertips. And he knew, then,
//that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the shadows of Death, would make him
//vulnerable once more. Even in the moment of making the decision, he might
//become unable to cast the Patronus Charm, for he would have given up the
//thought that had saved him before.

// 9989
//It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from Bellatrix
//afterward, even if he couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm; and then he had to
//wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus firmly on his decision
//__not__ to do it, or he might have just fallen over where he stood. For
//the whirlpool of emptiness swirling around him was now deadly strong; there
//were screams coming from __above__, and the screams below had stopped.

// 9990
//__This is ridiculous,__ said his logical side. __Rational agents
//shouldn’t have to put up with this sort of censored reasoning process, all the
//theorems assume that how you think doesn’t affect reality apart from your
//actual actions, which is why you’re free to choose an optimal algorithm without
//worrying about how your thoughts interact with Dementors -__

// 9991
//…

// 9992
//__That is a really dumb idea,__ said Gryffindor. __Even I think it’s
//a dumb idea and I’m your Gryffindor side. You’re not seriously going to just
//stand there and -__

// 9993
//“We have a fix!” shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as though in triumph.
//“The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to level seven, C spiral, that’s
//where they are!”

// 9994
//Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.

// 9995
//“No,” Amelia said in a level voice. “That’s where __one__ of them is. The
//Dementors still can’t find Bellatrix Black. We are not running down there and
//letting her through in the confusion, and we are not dividing our forces to be
//ambushed. So long as we move with caution, we can’t lose. Tell Scrimgeour and
//Shacklebolt to keep going down level by level, same as before -”

// 9996
//The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn’t even bother cursing
//him, this time, as once again their carefully constructed shields parted like
//water and rippled gently in his wake.

// 9997
//Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the stairs leading
//upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him, concealed by the Deathly
//Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew, though he could not see, that the
//emaciated sorceress was sitting upon the stairs, slumped back, since Harry had
//withdrawn his Hover Charm to free up his mind and magic.

// 9998
//Harry’s eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to the stairs that
//led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true reality, the light in the
//corridor had dimmed, the temperature had fallen. The fear thundered over him
//and around him like a sea whipped by hurricane winds, and the sucking emptiness
//had become a howling draw toward some approaching black hole.

// 9999
//Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the dying air, came the
//voids, the absences, the wounds in the world.

// 10000
//And Harry expected them to stop.

// 10001
//With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry __expected them to
//stop.__

// 10002
//Anticipated their stopping.

// 10003
//Believed they would stop.

// 10004
//…that was the idea, anyway…

// 10005
//Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and __expected the Dementors
//to halt.__ They had no intelligence of their own, they were just wounds in the
//world, their form and structure was borrowed from others’ expectations. People
//had been able to negotiate with them, offer them victims in exchange for
//cooperation, only because they __believed Dementors would bargain. __So if
//Harry believed hard enough that the voids would turn and go, they would turn
//and go.

// 10006
//But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear seemed like a solid
//thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as well as mind, substance as well
//as spirit, you could see the metal beginning to tarnish as the holes in the
//world passed.

// 10007
//A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said no word, for
//she had been instructed to remain silent.

// 10008
//__Don’t think of them as creatures, think of them as psychosensitive
//objects, they can be controlled if I can control myself -__

// 10009
//The problem was that he __couldn’t__ control himself so easily, couldn’t
//make himself believe blue was green by an act of will. Couldn’t suppress all
//those thoughts about how irrational it was to __make__ yourself believe
//something. How __impossible__ it was to trick yourself into believing
//something if you __knew__ that was what you were doing. All the training
//Harry had given himself against self-deception was refusing to switch off
//__no matter how harmful it was in this unique special case -__

// 10010
//The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor, and Harry held
//up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of firm and confident command,
//“Stop.”

// 10011
//The shadows of Death stopped.

// 10012
//Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being torn out of
//her.

// 10013
//Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance which meant,
//__repeat what you heard the Dementors say.__

// 10014
//“They say,” Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, “they said, ‘Bellatrix Black
//was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you will be spared.’”

// 10015
//“Bellatrix?” Harry said, making his voice sound amused. “She escaped a while
//ago.”

// 10016
//A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that Bellatrix was
//among the Aurors in the top level, that would have caused more confusion -

// 10017
//No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they were merely
//__things,__ they were controlled only by __expectations -__

// 10018
//“They say,” Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, “they say they know you’re
//lying.”

// 10019
//The voids began to move forward again.

// 10020
//__Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she is
//controlling them, unwittingly -__

// 10021
//“Don’t resist,” Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.

// 10022
//“I, I love you, farewell, my Lord -”

// 10023
//“__Somnium.__”

// 10024
//It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awful words,
//understanding Bellatrix’s mistake; it reminded Harry why he was fighting.

// 10025
//“Stop,” Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his own will, his own
//expectations rather, should control those spheres of annihilation -

// 10026
//But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from worrying
//that the previous experience had damaged his confidence, which meant that he
//__wouldn’t__ be able to stop them, and as he noticed himself thinking
//that, he doubted even more - he needed more time to prepare, really ought to
//practice controlling just one Dementor in a cage first -

// 10027
//There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the shadows of
//death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could feel the erosion
//beginning in the cracks of himself.

// 10028
//And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe Dementors
//__did__ have their own desires and planning capability. Or maybe they were
//controlled by how __everyone__ thought they worked, not just whoever was
//closest to them. And in either case -

// 10029
//Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the Patronus Charm, and
//spoke.

// 10030
//“One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It no longer exists;
//that Death is dead.”

// 10031
//The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood motionless, while the
//emptiness screamed around them like a deadly wind to nowhere.

// 10032
//“Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows, or I will
//destroy you as well.”

// 10033
//Harry’s fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus Charm, and
//readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone among the stars, the
//day side bright and blue with reflected sunlight, the night side glimmering
//with the light of human cities. Harry wasn’t bluffing, wasn’t trying to do
//anything tricky with his thoughts. The shadows of Death would move forward and
//be annihilated, or they would depart, he was equally ready for either…

// 10034
//And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds of nothingness
//lessening with each meter they traversed, as they slid back down the stairs,
//and departed.

// 10035
//Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whether Harry had
//finally succeeded in __expecting__ them to go… that, Harry didn’t know.

// 10036
//But they were gone.

// 10037
//Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix on the stairs,
//and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his eyes for a moment, only a
//moment, he sure as hell wasn’t planning to sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to
//take that moment. The Aurors would still be going down the stairs slowly, Harry
//hoped, so it wouldn’t hurt to take just five minutes to rest. Harry was careful
//to keep his thoughts positive, cheerful, __my, I’ll just have some nice
//regenerative rest here, and then I’ll feel better,__ rather than, say,
//__my, I’ll just collapse in emotional and physical exhaustion,__ because
//the Dementors hadn’t yet retreated very far.

// 10038
//__And by the way,__ Harry said to his brain, __you’re fired.__

// 10039
//“I found him!” cried the old wizard’s voice.

// 10040
//__Who?__ thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore’s return,
//carrying in his arms -

// 10041
//- the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected to behold -

// 10042
//- a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he’d fought a small war, blood
  //dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was chewing on a bar of
//chocolate, held in his one living hand.

// 10043
//Bahry One-Hand was __alive.__

// 10044
//A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of them already
//starting to rush forward.

// 10045
//“__Stay on guard!__” bellowed Amelia. “Check them both for Polyjuice -
//scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps -”

// 10046
//“__Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.__”

// 10047
//There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see, that the
//invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and turning her head to look
//around. “I’m… alive…?”

// 10048
//Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of that. Instead
//he hissed, “Don’t ask stupid questions.”

// 10049
//“What happened?” whispered Bellatrix.

// 10050
//And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, “I scared the
//Dementors away, my dear Bella.”

// 10051
//There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix’s face; had he said the
//wrong thing?

// 10052
//After a time, in a quavering voice, “Could it be, my Lord, that in your new
//form, you have begun to care for me -”

// 10053
//“No,” Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his wand on her),
//and began walking. “And take care that you do not offend me again, or I will
//abandon you here, use or no use. Now follow, or be left behind; I have work to
//do.”

// 10054
//Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that came from behind
//him; he knew Bellatrix was following.

// 10055
//…because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing she needed to
//start thinking before the psychiatric healer began trying to deprogram her, was
//to believe that her Dark Lord could ever love her back.

// 10056
//The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively, looking at where
//Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by two strong Aurors.

// 10057
//“Do you understand this, Amelia?”

// 10058
//“No,” she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn’t yet been able to
//fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept outside the main party
//and guarded.

// 10059
//“Perhaps,” the old wizard said at length, “whichever of their number can cast
//the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage. Someone who was tricked into
//this, mayhap? For whatever reason, they left your Auror alive; let us not be
//the first to wield deadly curses, when we find them -”

// 10060
//“I see,” said the old witch in sudden realization, “__that__ was their
//plan. It costs them nothing to Oblivate him and leave him alive, and makes
//__us__ hesitate -” Amelia nodded decisively, and said to her people, “We
//carry on as before.”

// 10061
//The old wizard sighed. “Any news from the Dementors?”

// 10062
//“If I tell you,” Amelia snapped, “will you run off again?”

// 10063
//“It costs you nothing, Amelia,” the old wizard said quietly, “and may save one
//of your own people the fight.”

// 10064
//__Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance -__

// 10065
//But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old wizard was often
//right in the end, it was part of what made him so annoying.

// 10066
//“The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other person they said
//they saw,” Amelia told him, “and they will not say why, nor where.”

// 10067
//Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder, whose light
//illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent headshake in reply. “I
//cannot detect them either,” said Dumbledore. Then he shrugged. “I suppose I
//shall just walk the whole spiral from top to bottom and see if anything turns
//up, shall I?”

// 10068
//Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that would have made
//the tiniest difference.

// 10069
//“Albus,” said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, “even you can be
//ambushed.”

// 10070
//“Nonsense, my dear,” the old wizard said cheerfully as he strode off yet again,
//waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand of unidentifiable
//dark-grey wood, “I’m invincible.”

// 10071
//There was a pause.

// 10072
//(“He didn’t just really say that -” whispered the newest Auror present, a
//still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to the senior member of her
//trio, Auror Brooks. “Did he?”)

// 10073
//(“He can get away with it,” Isabel whispered back to her, “he’s
//__Dumbledore,__ not even Fate takes him seriously anymore.”)

// 10074
//“And that,” Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger Aurors, “is why
//we never call him in on anything unless we absolutely must.”

// 10075
//Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of this cell, a
//blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely motionless as he could while he
//waited for the fear to return. There was a Patronus approaching, and a powerful
//one. Bellatrix was hidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easy Charm would penetrate
//that; but Harry did not know what other arts the Aurors might employ to detect
//his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking her. So Harry lay on
//a hard bed, in a cell with a locked door, and the mighty metal door locked
//behind him, in absolute darkness, with a thin blanket pulled over him, hoping
//that whoever it was wouldn’t look in, or wouldn’t look too closely if they did
//-

// 10076
//That wasn’t a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his fate lay
//entirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his mind was
//concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was performing.

// 10077
//Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps approach; they paused
//outside his door, and then -

// 10078
//- continued onward.

// 10079
//Soon the fear returned.

// 10080
//Harry didn’t allow himself to notice his own relief, any more than he allowed
//himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his mind the form of a Muggle
//device rather larger than a car battery, and slowly applying that Form to the
//substance of an ice cube (which Harry had frozen using __Frigideiro__ on
//water from a bottle in his pouch). You weren’t supposed to Transfigure things
//to be burned, but between the original substance being water, and the
//Bubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harry hoped that this wouldn’t
//make him or anyone else sick.

// 10081
//Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough time before the
//Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for Harry to finish this
//Transfiguration, and the partial Transfiguration he would do after that -

// 10082
//When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began to feel a
//twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had worked a third of the
//way down the three spirals, in synchrony so as not to allow any gap in their
//coverage that could be jumped by cutting through a ceiling, and they’d yet to
//find any sign.

// 10083
//“Might I ask you to report?” Amelia said, keeping the edge out of her voice.

// 10084
//“First a simple walk from top to bottom,” said the old wizard. He was frowning,
//wrinkling his face even more than usual. “I examined Bellatrix’s cell, and
//found a death doll left in her place. This escape was meant to go unremarked, I
//think. There is something hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left
//that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine. On the return trip, I opened each
//door and looked within the cells. I saw nothing Disillusioned, only the
//prisoners -”

// 10085
//They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix, and all her
//Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an urgent demand that
//almost started Amelia running from the corridor on the spot.

// 10086
//“- in rather distressing condition,” Dumbledore said quietly. For a moment the
//blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon glasses. “Will any of you speak
//to me of the consequences of their actions?”

// 10087
//“__I__ did not -” Amelia began.

// 10088
//“I know,” said the old wizard. “My apologies, Amelia.” He sighed. “Some of the
//more recent prisoners had scraps of their magic left, when I looked upon them,
//but I sensed no uneaten power; the strongest had only as much magic left as a
//first-year child. I heard Fawkes scream in distress many times, but never
//challenge. It seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well
//enough to escape my mere glance.”

// 10089
//When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled back the
//blanket that had covered him, cast a quick __Lumos,__ glanced at his
//watch, and was shocked to see that nearly an hour and thirty minutes had
//passed. How much of that time had gone by since someone had opened the door and
//then closed it again - Harry hadn’t been looking in that direction, of course -
//that, Harry couldn’t guess.

// 10090
//“My Lord…?” whispered Bellatrix’s voice, soft and very tentative.

// 10091
//“You may speak now,” Harry said. He’d told her to remain silent while he
//worked.

// 10092
//“That was Dumbledore who looked upon us.”

// 10093
//Pause.

// 10094
//“Interesting,” Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not noticed this at the
//time. That sounded like a __rather close shave__.

// 10095
//Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the magical device that
//he would mate to the product of his hour’s labor. Then, when that was drawn
//forth, another word brought forth a tube of industrial-strength glue; before
//using it, Harry cast the Bubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had
//Bellatrix cast the same Charm on the snake, so that the glue fumes in the
//enclosed cell would not harm them.

// 10096
//When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic, Harry laid it down
//upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting his magic and will for a
//moment before essaying the next Transfiguration.

// 10097
//“My Lord…” Bellatrix said hesitantly.

// 10098
//“Yes?” said the dry voice.

// 10099
//“What is that device you made?”

// 10100
//Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his plans with
//her, under the guise of leading questions.

// 10101
//“Consider, my dear Bella,” said Harry smoothly. “How difficult is it for a
//powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?”

// 10102
//There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s voice came, slow and puzzled, “Not
//difficult at all, my Lord…?”

// 10103
//“Indeed,” said the dry, high voice of Bella’s master. “Suppose one were to do
//this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and soar up and away. Rescuing
//a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy then, would it not?”

// 10104
//“But my Lord…” said Bella. “The Aurors would - they have their own broomsticks,
//my Lord, fast ones -”

// 10105
//Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied, again in tones
//of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a further question, which
//Harry had not expected, but Harry’s own counterquestion showed that it should
//not matter in the end. And in response to Bellatrix’s last question, the Dark
//Lord only smiled, and said that it was time for him to resume his work.

// 10106
//And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the far end of the
//cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of the wall - the wall of
//Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them from direct exposure to the
//Dementors’ pit.

// 10107
//And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.

// 10108
//This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He’d spent hours and hours practicing
//the unique magic, which had made it routine, not much more difficult for him
//than ordinary Transfiguration. The shape he was changing had not all that much
//total volume, the Transfigured shape might be tall and wide and long, but it
//was very thin. Half a millimeter, Harry had thought, would be enough,
//considering the perfect smoothness…

// 10109
//On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had set down the
//Transfigured technological device and the mated magic item for the glue to dry,
//tiny letters in golden script gleamed on the Muggle artifact. Harry hadn’t
//really __planned__ for them to be there, but they’d kept running through
//the back of his mind, and so seemed to have become part of the Transfigured
//form.

// 10110
//There were many different things Harry could have said before using this
//particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any number of things that would
//be, in one sense or another, appropriate. Or at least things that Harry
//__could__ have said, __would__ have said, if Bellatrix had not been
//there.

// 10111
//But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get the chance to
//say just this once, and probably never get a better chance to say ever again.
//(Or __think,__ anyway, if he couldn’t say it.) He hadn’t seen the actual
//movie, but he’d seen a preview, and for some reason the phrase had stuck in his
//mind.

// 10112
//The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,

// 10113
//__All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!__
